* elevator pitch
what does the humanities do in a world that is unhuman?

the world is increasingly unhuman. We have a tough time dealing with that but there are a few ways.

people always trying to reach into unhuman dimension, even though they can't, subjectivity doesn't go there

eroes: people who stick their hands into the unhuman realm am are screwing everyone else over THATS WHAT BUGS ME
systems should be more LEGIBLE to people

* solutions
 - hackcessibility
 - openness

reader says that there is room to interrogate the application of the term/concept of diaability - is there such a thing as monolithic disability, as a community or as a label?

i'd say no. disability is an identity, but we all experience a negotiation between self and the environment that can be read as disability. there is no perfect "ability" to measure against, everyone is disabled in this way. disability as identity occurs when abilities are too far from a normative baseline, or if the condition incurs a social stigma.

Disability Studies Quarterly
Winter 2004, Volume 24

C.S. Lewis himself "cures" Diggory's mother in The Magician's Nephew, as his own mother was not cured, but masks his longing in allegory and another world. There is, however, the possibility of creating a realistic setting in which a magical cure genuinely happens—such as that of Jack's father. To do this, when magical cures are so often wished for in real life, seems to me irresponsible; the realistic fantasies, where things "ought to happen, would have happened if the reader had had a fair chance" are the most dangerous.

* Arts of Living, Spellmeier
"experience of freedom"
academics too disconnected from public
culture wars a war between different elites

contends that, though business-mindedness is pushing aside humanities, we have to acknowledge the benefits that has brought
- i disagree with this, his examples don't hold up, i.e. half of Americans would prefer to retire later not because they love their jobs but because of finances

emerson's over-soul
- the agreement or resonance between an individual and the world
- academics are out of touch with this

William James
- the subconscioius is the world, the world outside you
- the purpose of thinking is to deal pragmatically with the next moment
- what is conscious one moment may be unconscious or subconscioius the next

takes issue with Theory as pre-packaged philosophical systems divorced from real application
- disagrees that theory can be pure reflection

while Theory presents itself as a tool for the repressed, it's actually a tool for the hyperspecialized academic inaccessible to the ordinary citizen

Theory markets itself to academics who wish to be like the sciences, it's a "science of signs"

Theory is on the decline because it now feels like an empty ritual

major issue: humanities scholars are socially isolated, they cannot write about things people care about, such as "science, sexuality, the film industry, urban life, or other pressing issues" (17)

the "explorion of knowledge in the modern world" (18) has dispelled much of the authority of the professor, Theory might be considered one way to get it back

"no particular knowledge has any value at all. What matters in our society is the ability to produce more knowledge of use to more people, or to circulate existing knowledge in unprecedented ways. Social power comes not from what we know but from what we can do with what we know, from the capacity to act creatively." (19)


"... this circumspection owes much more to Matthew Arnold than it does to Karl Marx. It was Arnold, after all, who first defined the critical intellectual as the person who does no worldly work, and who, by eschewing all practical engagement and know how, can think “above the fray,” so to speak. 31 In effect, Arnold establishes a ruinous division of labor. To the sciences, to business, and to government he cedes all worldly action, while securing for the humanities an austerely contemplative role. Men of the world are left to clash on the darkling plain like the ignorant armies in the poem “Dover Beach,” while the humanists pass judgment retrospectively from on high. In the early decades of the twentieth century, this division of cultural labor seemed ideal for granting human- ities departments a place at the table of leadership, but what do humanists concretely know? And what real-world venues are there for the knowledge that we actually have? Our problem is precisely that the view from above is too blurry and too dark, and that no one below can hear us, or could understand us if they did. We need to step down." (20)

his examples of people who are real-world humanists  seem dated and lmited--ehrlich? reallY? the population bomb?

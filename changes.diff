 * Introduction
 
 Consider yourself, for a moment, from the outside. You open a door, put on your shoes, move a chair to where you will need it. Or you speak with a friend, hit send on an important email, give a talk to your gathered colleagues. Imagine, briefly, that your act is something concrete—a weight in the world, a drawn thread, a radiating light, or a shared breath. This moment, or this act, is an encounter. You push on the world, and the world pushes back. There is you, and there is everything else. But, fleetingly, there is a space between.

 [fn:instantiation] Instantiation is the act of bringing something concrete into being based on an abstract ideal or template.

From /Phaedo/: "you would loudly asseverate that you know of no way in which anything comes into existence except by participation in its own proper essence, and consequently, as far as you know, the only cause of two is the participation in duality—this is the way to make two" [[citep:plato_six_2012][p. 77]].

 The argument here, crucially, is not that technology is the next best thing, and we must get on board or be left behind. Rather, we /have/ been left behind, and the modes in which technology has been exercised in society have resulted in a profound disjunction between our values and those of the encircling collective. In order to speak to that which we cannot agree with in the broader society—surveillance capitalism, pseudo-sovereign corporations, algorithmic bias, power in the hands of a few—we must have an understanding of the technological basis of the structures we oppose. Further, we must have in hand our own vision of an opposing /technê/, a craft to practice, build, and live in autonomy or resistance. At the least, we must be able to apply our core methods as humanists, our interpretive faculty, in difficult and epistemologically alien circumstances.

 "infrastructure," the social-cum-technological milieu that at once enables the fulfillment of human experience and enforces constraints on that experience, today has much of the same scale, complexity, and general cultural impact as the idea of "culture" itself. indeed, it may be that in late modernity when the bulk of life and work occurs in organizational institutions of one kind or another, the experience of infrastructure at institutional scales (undergirded by national or regional infrastructures such as electricity grids and global-scale infrastructures such as the internet) is operationally the experience of "culture." Put another way, the word "infrastructure" can now give us the same kind of general purchase on social complexity that stuart hall, raymond williams, and others sought when they reached for their all-purpose word, "culture." citep:liu_drafts_2016

Under the rubric of Critical Infrastructure Studies, scholars such as Alan Liu, Clare Birchall, Tara McPherson, Matthew K.

Critical Infrastructure Studies combines an awareness of diverse but interrelated work in history (Thomas Hughes, Tom Standage), social sciences (Susan Leigh Star, Bruno Latour, Hannah Appel, Nikhil Anand Akhil Gupta), and national-level humanities computing (Sheila Anderson).

 # The focus of much of the scholarship that has inspired Critical Infrastructure Studies has been macroscopic—broad in scope and attempting to synthesize individual observations into an understanding of larger trends. In this chapter, I offer a view of infrastructure that is more mesoscopic—that is, attuned to the locus of interaction between an individual and community, or a community and its wider social and technological context. In outlining issues facing our community of practice in the humanities, I will necessarily discuss macroscopic trends, including adverse economics, the platformification of the academy, and barriers to unflinching public scholarship. In considering adaptations to these issues, however, I will advocate a hyperlocal view, one that arises out of immediate concerns within a community and which, even if adopted broadly across communities, remains responsive to individuated conditions and needs.

 Throughout the novel, Connie is, by turns, physically injured, insulted, and ignored at the hands of authority figures—social workers, mental ward attendants, doctors, and police.

 Throughout the novel, Luciente's future, in which systems of oppression based on gender, race, and cognition have been largely dismantled, provides a contrast with the injustice and humiliation experienced by Connie in the present. The Mattapoisett of 2137, however, is not the only future that Connie visits in the novel. Connie receives flashes of another eventuality, one in which oligarchs dominate humanity through rigid control and categorization: "Control of genetics. Technology of brain control. Birth-to-death surveillance. Chemical control through psychoactive drugs and neurotransmitters" [[citep:piercy_woman_1983][p. 216]]. In this future, Connie encounters Gildina, a woman who has undergone extensive surgery, including lightening her skin, to make herself more attractive to a hegemonic, and exclusively male, ruling caste. In this future, life outside controlled indoor spaces is intolerable due to environmental degredation, and practices such as cooking are unknown to Gildina and others in her position. For Gildina, there is only exploitation and entertainment—the situation into which she has been forced is without community, curiosity, purpose, or growth.

 For Connie, the technology on display at Mattapoisett is something of a disappointment. Technology should be striking, imposing, rather than integrated into the existing context. For Connie, and for us, technology is associated with specific aesthetics—it should evoke awe, fear, or wonder. The aesthetic form most strongly associated with technology is the sublime, or the mode connected to confrontations with the vast, the new, or the ineffable: 
 
 #+BEGIN_QUOTE
 The sublime ... is an essentially religious feeling, aroused by the confrontation with impressive objects, such as Niagara Falls, the Grand Canyon, the New York skyline, the Golden Gate Bridge, or the earth­shaking launch of a space shuttle. ... [T]he emotion, although ineffable, is not inevitable. Over time, the same objects cannot always be counted upon to evoke the sublime response. Their power often decays, and other alternatives are sought. Ultimately, the constant is not the technological object per se; it is the continual redeployment of the sublime itself ... citep:nye_american_1996

 Our strong association of technology with tech is profoundly limiting.

Is a family recipe not an algorithm? Is a support group not a platform? Is a personal library not infrastructure? Certain forms of technology are glorified, even fetishized, while essential ways of knowing and doing are systematically undervalued. A technology, ultimately, is knowledge put into practice. Why do we hold up technologies of control, technologies of corporations, governments, and the powerful, while eliding, downplaying, disparaging, or ignoring the technology of individuals and localities, small groups and "little" disciplines?

 This concept, techne, may help us to reframe our discourse around technology and "tech." Technology, as a term, likely deserves the negative connotations that have grown up around it. Tech has come to be associated with a discrete set of centralized and corporate projects with universal aspirations, such as to organize the world's information, sell any form of material good, or build an intermediating platform through which all human thought and communication are conducted. These projects, tech, are not technologies in the sense of those drawn from basic research that have so fundamentally altered life on earth over centuries, and which range from the quotidian (the barometer) to the miraculous (antibiotics) to the terrifying (nuclear weapons). While this conception of technology may be morally and practically ambiguous, neither are these technologies controlled by a single individual or organization. These fundamental technologies, though they may have extensive forseen and unforseen negative effects on humanity and the earth, cannot control and be controlled as can the modern tech platform. Further, the set of projects that define tech, in their broad scope and universal aims, cannot but violate our autonomy and trample local concerns and needs. To build an everything store, or to collect and control all human knowledge, is necessarily to call on /das Man/, and perhaps even to invoke something beyond, and even more inimical, than the human universal.
 
-When we think of tech, we think of paradigms situated on the level of macro-scale entities and institutions—societies, nations, and corporations. This form of "technology" reaches, from on high, down into our lives. It offers us capabilities and connections, identity and convenience. It leverages iterative design, social science, and algorithm to nudge, rather than compel, recalcitrant humanity into engaging systems that control, flatten, and measure. We are grist in a highly abstract mill, our thoughts content, our relationships network effects, our differences market segments and our common humanity an exploited vulnerability. Tech empowers, but only to the extent that we further render ourselves powerless.[fn:fish]

-We begin to see, perhaps, that the word "technology" fails to serve us. We can, broadly and without fine distinctions, consider the term "technology" to refer to three separate phenomena. The first, scientific technology or technology classic, describes applications of basic research, and is characterized by unpredictable second- and third-order effects and sweeping social changes. Technologies in this vein might include the steam engine, anesthesia, heavier-than-air flight, radio, birth control, computation, nuclear energy, antibiotics, and chemical fertilizers. These technologies, which shocked and shaped the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, can be associated with the aesthetic of the sublime in that they provoked awe and fear, the sense of the small in the presence of the surpassing and the ineffable. The second, tech, poses in the guise of scientific technology, self-consciously embracing the aesthetic of the technological sublime while delivering a calculated, rather than an uncontrolled, disruption. The essential difference between scientific technology and tech is in this retained control. Google is tech, and not technology, because any advances it represents do not escape its ambit. The horse may pull society, but its reins are firmly held. Prometheus has descended from the mountain, but we must beg for the light.

-Culturally, we have come to expect, and perhaps to rely on, the unifying experiences provided by the technological sublime and the larger narrative of progress they uphold. Starting in the late 1990s, and with little fanfare, tech, rather than scientific technology, began to supply these cultural experiences. In the relative absence of major cultural disruptions or novums from scientific technology, tech has meted out a succession of upgrades and updates to platforms, providing conveniences that have grown into necessities and preserving the sense that society is moving forward technologically.[fn:technological-decline] By preserving a simulacra of technological progress, tech has presided over a reallocation of market power unprecedented in recent history, a transfer that has placed a small number of firms in a position to extract exorbitant rents, acquire or drive out competition, create new classes of contingent labor, and nfluence the political sphere. While scientific technology acted as a cultural wildcard, creating unpredictable second- and third-order effects, tech seeks to crate a more predictable form of disruption in which power accrues to the firm and negatives, such as the decline of journalism or an increase in political polarization, are borne by the broader society and the public.

 [fn:technological-decline] This point, that there has been little (scientific or fundamental) technological advancement in the 21st century may be surprising to some, though it is growing increasingly difficult to ignore. The slowdown is difficult to perceive partly because tech, or the platformification of society, has provided substantial cultural disruptions over the first two decades of the new century. As even the simulacrum of technological advance that has been provided by tech slows, however, the lack of significant new applications of basic research to day-to-day living is becoming more widely recognized.
 
-A hard look at the scientific and technological advances developed over the first two decades of the twenty-first century are immediately recognizable as incremental at best, and many or most can be associated with hype and potential rather than obvious or broad utility. One set—e-readers, home automation, online streaming—have disrupted specific industries and generated enormous value for a small number of corporations. Another set—3D printing, machine learning, gene editing, blockchain, augmented and virtual reality—have created fortunes based primarily on a perceived future potential that has largely not been actualized. Other technologies are useful, if incremental: a better artificial pancreas, e-cigarettes, tokenization for payment, new techniques for endoscopy.

 The most immediately recognizable achievement, and perhaps the representative cultural symbol, of the twenty-first century, is, of course, the smartphone. The smartphone perhaps best represents the shift from scientific technology to tech, and probably alone accounts for the survival of a rhetoric of progress this far into the new century. Though it is suggestive of a fundamental advance, the smartphone as a piece of tech has been entirely controlled by two corporations, and has facilitated widespread platformification. It is a tool that transforms moments of reality—interactions between individuals, or with the built or natural environment—into engagements with a strictly controlled hyperreality. As an artifact, the smartphone is in no sense manipulable by its owner. It is unmodifiable and unrepairable. Though meaningful functional changes are rare, the smartphone must be frequently replaced, both for profit and to maintain an aura of steady technological progress. Unlike advances in scientific technology, the smartphone represents no new understanding that can be built upon, except, perhaps, for a new understanding of the malleability of humanity in the aggregate.

-Tech has been the primary beneficiary of a confusion between scientific technology and tech. Semantic and cultural conflation in the modern usage of "technology" benefits tech in a number of ways. Tech has been given significant political leeway in part because the political sphere is hesitant to interfere with a narrative of progress. Because tech is positioned as an instantiation of technology, the political classes and society at large frequently turn toward tech when confronted with large or intractable problems..

-It is tempting to think of techne entirely as only a reconnection with the traditional, a rejection of inimical circumstances through a return to the past. To limit techne in this way, however, is to cede the future. Techne is the artist remixing traditional music on a Pocket Operator, the college student putting up her own website to sell homemade soap, the third-world hacker making a hearing aid from obsolete parts. These acts do an end run around extractative abstraction, drawing a line to the world that does not run through some grasping platform. Techne is technology of the local over the universal, autonomy over imposition, and continuity over disruption. Techne tends to create more than it extracts, to be gnarly rather than slick, to prefer the long game to the fast exit. Techne can be kind of janky—what humanity is there in perfection?

-Techne and abstraction are not entirely incompatible. Technology that empowers others, that respects real difference, that encourages growth, or that cedes control to others can be techne, and can respect and encourage techne. Raspberry Pi, the $35 credit-card sized minicomputer, is, in a sense, a platform. However, the Pi, and the foundation that produces it, cede control: the device can be used for anything a small computer can be used for. In its mild jankiness, the Pi encourages real learning and growth.[fn:growth] In its lack of expense, the Pi makes possible projects and pedagogy that would otherwise be out of reach. In these qualities, The Pi, as a platform, builds, rather than exploits, community, and creates oxygen rather than sucking it from the room. There is nothing perfect about the Pi, but in its imperfection it is a thing of techne, and far from the slick affordances of tech.

 [fn:growth] The learning comes as users try to answer questions, such as "What are all these little holes" "Is this thing on?" And "Which part is most likely to draw blood if I poke it the wrong way?" Learning can be painful. Really, though, the Pi is an amazing device, and I'm glad it exists, as both a machine and a community.

 The preconditions set by developments in scientific technology during the twentieth century, especially, but not exclusively, computation, have led to unprecedented forms of abstraction. Developments such as the web have encouraged novel forms and permutations of techne, including new modes of expression and art, widely available repositories of knowledge, and local communities that extend beyond geography. However, in parallel, tech and other centralizing forces have come to displace local autonomy and agency. Intermediating interfaces that flatten intent, algorithmically-curated streams, and the aggregation and analysis of personal data has allowed tech to bootstrap its way to a set of more traditional abuses: monopoly and monopsony[fn:monopsony], regulatory capture, aggressive acquisition of other firms, bundling or tying, blacklisting[fn:anti-competitive].

 There is a tragedy to mass cultivation of apples. Apples are the most sprayed crop, and in cultivated orchards they stand, cloned, grafted to alien rootstock for survival. In the wild, or in a feral orchard, however, they are transformed into hardy and long-lived trees. Apple trees are naturally social, and do best at the edges of forests and in other locations where that can be with trees of other species. They attract and feed a diverse array of creatures. Heterozygous, all apple trees produce unique fruit, so every uncultivated apple tree encountered represents a new strain of apple.
 
-Extractative systems, including the Abstraction, are powerful engines, but in their artificiality there is an element of fragility. Often, they are forced to take longcuts where shortcuts might do. By encircling so much, by growing large, they become unaware of knowledge at the level of the local. By acting at scale, by coordinating the effort of many from above, they lose the ability to act simply. While there is a tailwind to be found by reaching up into the Abstraction to take advantage of centralizing and extractative trends, those working locally may be able to walk to where the Abstraction could visit only by building a highway. By cultivating thickets, dense webs of interdependent relationships, we obscure our work from above and protect spaces from whence further resistance might grow. Though growing literal thickets has its benefits[fn:no-mo], seeding various forms of richly interdependent community can preempt enclosure by abstractative forces. Wikipedia provides an example of one such thicket. Its presence makes economically unviable various forms of knowledge aggregation and resale, and its dense ecosystem of community relationships raises the cost of cooptation.

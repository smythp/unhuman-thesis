* Introduction

We must make for ourselves, or be made upon.

This is the foundational argument of this project, a project grounded in disability studies and traveling outward. 

There are points of intersection between self and community, self and society, and community and society. The back-and-forth that occurs across these points, the negotiation among self, community, and society, is enabled and constrained by infrastructure—past decisions and creations that determine the possible and the impossible, the simple and the difficult, the accessible and the inaccessible. Though without infrastructure, individuals can do little, deliberate choices in how infrastructure is created constrain the self, coercing, influencing, or nudging the individual into the service of interests not their own. Infrastructure is necessary, but is frequently created to serve the powerful, the acquisitive, or the majoritarian.

Infrastructure, however, can be turned, subverted, or reinvented to serve community and the individual. /Negotiated Access/ focuses on communities of practice—particularly communities of people with disabilities—who reforge the inaccessible into the accessible, or create knowledge and community in adverse circumstances.

* Introducing Negotiated Access
** Terry Garrett
On May 8, 2011, a blind gamer named Terry Garrett began playing Zelda: The Ocarina of Time. The game, widely considered a classic, depicts a 3D world populated with puzzles, enemies, and difficult terrain. It also offers no intentional concessions to a blind player using only sound cues, memory, and dogged persistence to navigate the game world. 

Five years later, Garrett completed his playthrough. Using binaural audio, he'd found that he could map entities and terrain in the environment. Inaudible features could be struck with objects to produce identifying sounds, and a combination of trial-and-error and external research allowed him to pass traps and solve puzzles.

What conception of disability allows us to best understand Garrett's achievement? Two models have come to dominate narratives of and advocacy for disability. The first, the medical model, sees disability as a personal tragedy that can only be resolved by a cure or mitigation from the medical community. Implicit in this perspective is the assumption that disability is a social aberration, a condition that must be cured or obscured. The social model of disability, on the other hand, envisions disability as a societal concern, and contends that most negative outcomes from disability stem from the ignorance, indifference, or bias of the wider, largely able, community. Proponents of the social model seek attitudinal and public policy changes to eliminate difficulties associated with stigma and a lack of understanding about disabled lives.

How well do these models address the challenges faced by Garrett as he, a blind gamer, engaged with a creation designed without knowledge of his circumstances? The solutions offered by the medical model offer only a binary outcome. Either Garrett's disability is cured or ameliorated, allowing him to engage with the game in the socially prescribed way, or it is not. If no cure is forthcoming, then the medical model of disability is silent, offering no further recourse. Under the medical model, therefore, the challenge Garrett has set for himself could only be regarded as an impossibility.

The social model has far more to offer. In the last few years, communication among disabled gamers and developers has led to the release of a small but notable list of games in formats accessible to those with mobility and sensory disabilities. This short list, which has included titles such as Skull Girls and King of Dragon Pass, has shown that awareness and advocacy can led to concrete change even in gaming, a community that is often explicitly ableist in its outlook and rhetoric. However, though notable, these successes have been limited in scope. The overwhelming majority of games and game developers do not consider the needs of mobility- and sensory-impaired gamers, and many developers that become aware of specific disabilities argue that it's simply impossible for them to adapt their games for those with disabilities such as missing limbs or blindness. Even disabilities that are common and relatively simple to mitigate in games, such as color blindness, have received only limited attention. Further, widely used platforms that must be navigated to access games in the first place, such as the menus on the Playstation 4 console or the Steam game distribution service for PC, remain inaccessible, even in the face of an ADA ruling that requires that, at minimum, the communications and chat features in games must be made accessible.

*************** TODO State of gaming for people with disabilities

When considering Garrett's struggle to complete a game designed exclusively for sighted players, it's clear—and unsurprising to those following disability studies—that the perspective provided by the social model is more productive than that provided by the medical model. While the medical establishment would have little or no interest in Garrett's experience as a case study, the social model suggests ways that society could change to better accommodate the goals of Garrett and other disabled gamers. Were developers in games to equip menus with audio or voice cues, for example, gamers like Garrett would not be forced to memorize interfaces through trial and error or with sighted assistance. Despite the salience of the social model to Garrett's experience, however, there is an aspect—a critical aspect—of his effort that falls outside the usual scope of the social model as we know it.

** A Negotiated Model of Disability

The disabled experience is typically—though not universally—characterized by distinct relationships between the individual and the lived environment. Consider the cane, an implement that, in its differing forms, is almost metanymous with mobility and sensory disabilities. For the blind and for many who are mobility impaired, the cane is an emblem of independence. When picking up a cane, the relationship among certain disabled individuals and their lived environment is powerfully altered. Distances shrink and senses expand. Daniel Kish, an advocate for unorthodox mobility strategies for the blind, describes the experience:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Now, moving forward, how do I manage today? ... Fortunately, I have my trusty long cane, longer than the canes used by most blind people. I call it my freedom staff.
#+END_QUOTE

Yet the cane, and the myriad other rhetorical, physical, cognitive, and emotional strategies deployed by the disabled, are not cures. Their use and deployment is necessarily idiosyncratic, unique to specific disabled individuals and their affinity groups. Their use or presence also often visibly sets disabled individuals apart. Unlike the medical cure, which seeks to normalize pathology and efface difference, the myriad strategies deployed by disabled people to negotiate physical and cultural spaces are a source of difference. This difference is primarily one of perception--it goes both ways, consisting both of how disabled people are perceived by others and how they themselves perceive the world. XXX

Yet while we know that the medical model often fails to address or encompass disabled experience, the social model, for all its importance and usefulness, also does not address a significant portion of disabled life. In raising a cane—or in lip reading, using a screen reader, or adapting a vehicle to a mobility impairment——the disabled individual asserts a kind of power that does not flow from their approval or status in the wider community. Simultaneously, they assert their own identity, both individually and as part of an affinity group. Drawing on their understanding of their own situation and their relationship with the lived environment, the disabled individual /negotiates/. That is, they negotiate their environment, reforging relationships among their own bodies and the physical world. They negotiate with others, learning to survive in social milieus often characterized by ignorance and hostility. They share, build, and teach amongst themselves, creating negotiables—knowledge, physical infrastructure, and social capital that are their own. These practices, universal and critical to survival but often invisible and unacknowledged, I describe in this project as "negotiated access."

Models of disability combine a means of conceiving of or envisioning disability with a prescribed way forward—that is, a way of improving—or attempting to improve—the lives of disabled people. For the medical model, this prescribed way forward is the cure, an effacement of disability. For the social model, the way forward is social change in the wider society, including advocacy for and understanding of the lives of disabled people. This chapter will articulate and explore a third model of disability, the negotiated model, intended to augment the critical work already done under the aegis of the social model. Like existing models of disability, this model provides both a way to conceive of and situate disability and a way forward, a means of improving the lives of disabled people. 

This negotiated model is not a call for new types of work to be done to improve the lives of disabled people, because negotiated forms of access have been, and continue to be, practiced by people with disabilities in myriad forms. This model of access has, however, been underexamined in the context of disability studies and in the academy more widely. A goal of this project, therefore, is to focus attention on excellent work that is, and that arguably has always been, underway by practitioners in the wider disability community, and to provide a framework to better understand and contextualize this labor. Further, this project seeks to connect a theoretical understanding of negotiated access to related work in other domains. These connections include the digital humanities, with its emphasis on critical making and infrastructure, and utopian studies, which explores alternative relationships among bodies and their environments. Just as applications of the social model of disability have advanced discourses in a variety of disciplines, the negotiated model of disability can contribute to a wider understanding of affinity groups that develop practices, knowledges, and infrastructure that push back against complicit orthodoxy and normalizing forces.

So, again: what conception of disability allows us to best understand Garrett's achievement—completing, independently as a blind individual, a game designed exclusively for the sighted? If it's not yet clear, my answer to this question is the negotiated model of disability. While advocacy and social progress on the rights of disabled gamers might have helped, and could yet help, individuals such as Garrett, it was not this form of social progress that allowed Garrett to overcome this challenge. It also goes without saying that no (entirely theoretical) cure contributed to his victory. Rather, Garrett's accomplishment was the result of a successful negotiation of the lived environment. In approaching an apparently inaccessible game as he did, Garrett forced a redefinition of his relationship with it. creating infrastructure—a path—where no infrastructure existed before. Garrett's achievement also shares many characteristics of negotiated access that will be discussed in depth in this chapter, among them an idiosyncratic, exploratory,  or free-form approach ("haccessability"); the creation of new practices, knowledge, or material in service of a disability affinity group ("critical making"), and contribution to the formation of disabled affinity groups and a federated, rather than totalizing, disabled identity ("XXX").

Finally, it's essential to note that negotiated access is not an exceptional or extraordinary state for disabled individuals. Rather, it's a daily, or even hourly, fact of life. Case studies such as Garrett's and the others that will be discussed below garner focus and attention in both disabled and non-disabled communities, making them attractive for citation, discussion, and inclusion in a text such as this one. For disabled individuals, however, negotiation of the lived environment is simply a fact of life, one generally performed without fanfare or even, in most cases, acknowledgment. In addition, those individuals whose achievements come to wider public attention are often, despite their disabled status, privileged in other ways. While this study will attempt to balance extraordinary examples of negotiated access with those in keeping with the daily struggles and successes of disabled life, I wish to acknowledge that "notable" achievements in this context are unfortunately often those marked out by able, rather than disabled, communities. To the extent that it is possible within the bounds of this project, I have sought out first-hand accounts and voices of disabled experience whenever possible.

** What is Negotiated Access?

Negotiated Access is advocacy, knowledge creation,  and the building of infrastructure that begins within an affinity group and radiates outward. It's rooted in the lived experience of people with disabilities and its locus is the idiosyncratic capabilities, skills, and practices that enable people with disabilities to survive and (sometimes) flourish in an able and ableist society. Negotiated Access addresses aspects of the disabled experience that are marginal or underacknowledged within current paradigms, particularly methods that do not rely on, or defy, the approval or approbation of the wider society. In some cases, negotiation may require, or involve, passing—temporarily merging with the perception of the dominant able class to extract withheld support or necessary acknowledgement or concessions. At other times, negotiation involves practices that are considered asocial, resistant, or antisocial by the wider able community. Negotiation, therefore, tends to be at the periphery of the disabled experience, in the actions that are not easily narrativized or made legible by the community at large, but  which are a means of survival for individuals and their affinity groups.

While negotiated access flows from the personal and the idiosyncratic in the lives of people with disabilities, as a practice and as a critical lens it is also a vector for political and cultural energy. As we will see, negotiated access throws light on disability as an identity and the relationships among disability affinity groups, the narrativization of disability in media, the rise of transhumanism and the pathologization of humanity, the articulation of values through infrastructure, the implications of proprietary and commercial ideologies on the body, and the imagination and implementation of crip utopias. Negotiated access, and related concepts such as haccessibility, suggest ways we can advance both on-the-ground advocacy in the disabled community and augment our understanding of disability through the lens of the social model. Closely examining the unidealized, day-to-day interactions among disabled people and society, however, also raises a host of theoretical questions, not just about disabled life but also about how society at large reflects, or fails to reflect, our values.

** Hacking Accessibility

*************** TODO History of hackers and parallels to accessibility

If infrastructure comprises material and social circumstances, such as roads, housing, communications systems, organizations, laws, and resources, that determine what is practical and possible, then haccessibility is the creation of personal infrastructure that expands the boundaries of the possible in ways that are personal, small-scale, and resistant to larger forces. The term can apply to anyone, whether teenagers (mis)using mentions of promoted brands on Facebook to receive a signal boost from its algorithm or the business executive who uses his desktop computer as a footstool. However, the term is most significant for the disabled, since adaptations, workarounds, prosthetics, individualized skills, and acts of provocation and resistance are critical to their ability to survive and thrive in an able world. Beyond its tendency toward self-determination, another critical aspect of haccessibility is its indifference to propriety and the need or desire to "pass" in wider society. Like the old-school hackers from which the term is derived, those who practice haccessibility often violate boundaries in order to expand their capabilities, explore their environment, and play at the boundaries of the acceptable, the possible, and the expected.

*** Defining Haccessibility

**** What is Hacking?

"Hacker" is a contested term, one with a set of meanings and associations highly dependent on context and culture. For most, the hacker is figured as a modern-day boogieman or, at best, a trickster. In the news, depictions of the hacker have shifted from a suburban adolescent capable of bringing about nuclear Armageddon to a faceless assortment of criminal collectives to, more recently, the chosen tool of adversarial state actors for subverting Western institutions. Casually and less consistently, in cases of motivated interest the term hacker may be used to describe whistleblowers who exfiltrate data, such as Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden, or researchers who point out security vulnerabilities created by technical or policy decisions on the part of corporations or the government. In fiction, the hacker appears as an unreliable guide or, tamed, clears impediments from the path of the protagonist.

The original use of the word "hacker," one that survives to this day in a number of subcultures, is quite different from this popular figuration. The terms "hack" and "hacker" originated at MIT in the early sixties amongst a group of technically-minded students, many of whom participated in MIT's Tech model train club, the AI lab, or both.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The core members hung out at the club for hours; constantly improving The System, arguing about what could be done next, developing a jargon of their own that seemed incomprehensible to outsiders who might chance on these teen-aged fanatics [...]. [...] one who insisted on studying for courses was a "tool"; garbage was called "cruft"; and a project undertaken or a product built not solely to fulfill some constructive goal, but with some wildpleasure taken in mere involvement, was called a "hack."
#+END_QUOTE

For these early hackers, the word "hack" already had a number of related usages. One could "hack away" on a task or project, artlessly expending effort but making progress. One might implement a "quick hack," a suspect or unreliable solution that solves a problem in the short term. Most important, however, was the "excellent hack"—a striking or even transcendent solution that demonstrated intimate familiarity or mastery of a system.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
But as the TMRC [Tech Model Railroad Club] people used the word, there was serious respect implied. While someone might call a clever connection between relays a "mere hack," it would be understood that, to qualify as a hack, the feat must be imbued with innovation, style, and technical virtuosity. [...] The most productive people working on Signals and Power called themselves "hackers" with great pride.
#+END_QUOTE

Hackers, in this early use of the word, were those who worked on a problem—often technical——out of passion rather than obligation, and who sought a deep understanding of a system or domain. This early hacker culture valued "playful cleverness" (Stallman, 2002), collaborative work, and the sharing of resources and results. They also frequently flouted rules, procedures, and restrictions on access, often in attempts to gain a commodity that, at the time, was highly valuable and frequently out of reach—computer time. 

*************** TODO How did the term "hacker" come to mean criminal?

** Shared Concerns

Both hackers and people with disabilities are, fundamentally, concerned with the problem of access. Old-school hackers—the XXX and Richard Stallmans of the world—care about access because they have a primal need to dig into the core of a machine, system, or program. Without the access granted through informal peer groups or initiatives such as the free and open source software movement, the kind of exploratory work with which these first hackers are associated becomes impossible. Hackers of the other stripe, those appearing in news stories about state actors and data breaches, are also concerned with (frequently unauthorized) access. By definition, these hackers are outsiders seeking entrance to systems from which they have been excluded.

*************** TODO Something about justification here?

Much ink has been spilled over the relative legitimacy of various definitions of the word "hacker," particularly whether the term should be applied to criminals who gain unauthorized access to computers or curious and playful tecnophiles. In comparing elements of hacker culture to the concerns and practices of the disabled community, however, I will treat each of these interpretations of the term as legitimate. Therefore, the term "haccessibility" as it is used in this project draws on both the tradition of the hacker as playful, deeply skilled amateur and hacker as a specialist in gaining or preventing unauthorized access to systems.

People with disabilities, especially those in certain affinity groups, often gravitate toward playful, clever, or community-minded resolutions to daily struggles, casting them in a role similar to the "original" hacker. At the same time, the need to surmount obstacles presented by lack of accessibility just as often casts people with disabilities in the role of the hacker as outsider, criminal, and suspect.




 Clearly there are major differences in these communities, most notably that the subject position of the hacker as an outsider seeking access is frequently chosen, while the subject position of the disabled individual as an outsider is forced upon them.

While disabled gamers continue to pursue advocacy efforts, they have also engaged in a form of disability mitigation that is not generally acknowledged by the medical or social models of disability. If gaming interfaces are construed as a kind of infrastructure, one that attempts to determine not only the "what" of content and experience but also the "how" of method and interaction, then disabled gamers have, in large numbers, created their own infrastructure and support systems that defy constraints and carve new methods of engagement.

*** Out in the Cold, or Why I Care About This Stuff

Imagine that you travel to a library. As you walk in, shelves of books rise up around you. They contain thousands of volumes, including discourses on every possible subject. That's ideal, since you're on a mission—a research mission.

As you step toward a promising section, a custodian firmly grasps your elbow. Unfortunately, it seems, these books are not for you. You are led to an out-of-the-way room. The floor is uneven, the surfaces dusty. Clearly, this room is rarely used, and receives little attention. Inside are a few shelves containing an odd assortment of books. It is here, you infer, that you are to do your research.

Casting a longing look at the wider library outside, you decide to make the best of a bad situation. Though the volumes you expected to find are absent, two books do seem to be tangentially related to your research. However, as you take them over to a table and prepare to take notes, the custodian rushes in. 

"This book cannot be placed on that table!" 

He picks up the second book and removes it to a cramped desk in the corner. Though your brow creases with confusion, you begin to skim the book before you, looking for a relevant chapter. After a minute, the custodian appears again. ?Only fifty pages per day!" He places a metal clip on the remaining pages, binding them tightly together.

For some reason, this limitation is the last straw for you. You gather up your notes and what remains of your dignity and move toward the exit. You feel defeated, but a spark of something—defiance?—has been ignited within you. Somehow, you know, you'll find a way to read those books...

-----

An experience common to disability is being denied what others take as given. Whether ingress at a venue, the instruction conveyed at a lecture, or the knowledge contained in a building full of print books, commodities that are freely accessible to others must either be expensively procured, fought for, or done entirely without by people with disabilities.

The vignette above is my own attempt to partially convey my own subjective experience as a low-vision researcher. FOr me, print books are not artifacts that readily give up their secrets. Depending on the length of the book, it's physical characteristics, and whether I'm willing to destroy it in the process—mostly not an option—any book not already in digital form requires two to ten hours of laborious scanning and processing before it can be read. While this means that few print books are strictly inaccessible to me—though such books do exist, including those in nonstandard or archaic scripts—it does mean that I must be strategic in which print books I choose to address in my research.

Of course, the relatively recent rise of ebooks and related digital formats has proven a major boon to researchers—such as myself—who cannot read print. Access to a digital book circumvents the need for laborious scanning, and the result is often far superior, since imperfections in the scanning and optical character recognition processes often lead to unreadable text and the appearance of undesirable artifacts. Further, books that are machine-readable and shared online are also transformative for individuals with dyslexia and those who may have difficulty accessing a physical library. Access to digital books can also be an asset, or even a necessity, for non-disabled researchers who may not be geographically or economically situated for physical access to an institution or a community of supportive  practitioners.

 While digital books can, in theory, level the playing field for many disadvantaged readers, the experience of accessing such books is often, in keeping with the above vignette, prohibitively difficult. Most publishers, such as XXX and XXX, and digital book platforms, such as Ebrary, implement Digital Rights Management (DRM), impose usage limits, or require that books be read in the browser rather than downloaded, all in an attempt to prevent sharing or other copyright violations. Unfortunately, these interfaces are often not screen reader accessible, and reading a book in the browser is typically not feasible for those who read using text-to-speech or other assistive technology. These interfaces are often considered cumbersome  even by able users, and the inconsistency and fragmentation in these platforms also makes it difficult to extract quotations, take notes, or archive copies for further reading or future reference. 

It's difficult to fully convey the subjective experience of finding a book in a digital library and being, so to speak, turned away at the door. This experience is compounded by the knowledge that this denial is the product of a deliberate choice, or series of choices, on the part of the copyright holder or platform designer. Unlike print books, which require an active step in order to be made accessible, digital books require an active step to be made inaccessible. Unfortunately, this active step is too often taken, leaving those with print disabilities without access to essential resources.

What recourse does a blind researcher have when confronted with an inaccessible platform? One option is to purchase all books available in digital form. Unfortunately, academic books are often priced not for individuals, but for purchase by libraries, and these books can, in 2017, run in price from $80 to a heart-palpitating $300 for reference works, textbooks, or some edited collections. These costs often mean that the outlay for a second examination or thesis project could potentially run into the five figures. Unless one is independently wealthy, this is mostly not a viable choice for sourcing books for research.

Another option is to seek assistance from one's institution, whether through one's department or through a dedicated office of disability services. Results achieved through this approach can vary widely. These administrative services are often under-resourced.  XXX

While I have availed myself of these approaches in the past, my own methods for gaining access to these initially inaccessible bodies of knowledge are a little different. First, it requires an deep familiarity with the environment in which digital books are procured, stored, and consumed. Second, it demands significant investment, not only in knowledge but in various kinds of infrastructure. Lastly, it depends on an unconventional—or, perhaps more accurately, a /circuventional/—approach to access, one that seizes on alternative, creative, or exploratory routes to access. While this investment has demanded time and attention, the end product is that, rather than asking others to help me in sourcing research, I am frequently asked by other researchers for help in collecting materials for their own work.

The point of these observations is not to serve as a recommendation or recipe for other disabled researchers. Far from it—if anything, the amount of investment, of time and personal capital, required for such an approach shows only the difficulty and irreproducability of these methods. Instead, I share this background in order to frame my own interest in, and advocacy for, /haccessibility/—an approach to accessibility that draws on a culture that grew up around early computing, free and open source software, and the modern maker community.

** Why Can't We Talk about Infrastructure?

When seeking to critically analyze infrastructure, there is some question of where to start. Thomas Parke Hughes, in /Networks of Power/, observes that "Ludwig Bertalanffy, one of the most articulate of systems theorists, neededabook, not a paragraph, to define 'system'" (Hughes 5). In talking about infrastructure, we run into problems of scale and complexity. More importantly, however, we encounter problems of recognition. In studying infrastructure, we contend with a set of questions. How can we talk about infrastructure? Is infrastructure worth discussing? And, if it is, should we in the humanities be the ones to do it?

Infrastructure is complex. Not in the colloquial sense of "difficult to understand," though infrastructure is often that. Rather, it is complex in the sense of a whole comprised of multiple, frequently interdependent, parts. Because discussion of one facet of infrastructure frequently demands discussion of other facets, infrastructure is almost inherently difficult to discuss. Compounding this intractability is a problem of scale. In general, we—humanities scholars, academics more broadly, or people in general—perform poorly when considering the extremely large or the extremely small. Unfortunately, infrastructure is not a "meso-level" phenomenon. Infrastructure is the interstate highway system and the mineral balance of a drop of water. Infrastructure is levee maintenance in New Orleans and 220 billion lines of COBOL (Atwood). Infrastructure is this paper clip.

#+CAPTION: A paperclip. Eat your heart out, Adam Smith
#+NAME:   paperclip.jpg
[[./paperclip.jpg]]

Though scale, complexity, and interdependence pose a challenge to any discussion of infrastructure, to engaging the topic one must also wrestle with a second concern. David Foster Wallace puts his finger on this issue in his well-known graduation speech at Kenyon College:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
There are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, "Morning, boys, how's the water?" And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, "What the hell is water?"
#+END_QUOTE
Because of its ubiquity, infrastructure is invisible. It is the inescapable medium in which we live and act. Infrastructure determines which actions are trivial, like drawing water from a tap. In its absence, as when transporting oneself around Fayetteville, North Carolina—America's least walkable city in 2017— without a car, infrastructure sets the bounds of the impossible. Despite, or perhaps because of, its importance, it is difficult to think about infrastructure unless maintaining that infrastructure is a specific component of our work or our identity. Typically, our interactions with infrastructure manifest themselves as abstractions of convenience. We think of the thousands of data centers, the hundreds of thousands of miles of cable, and the dozens of exabytes of data stored on connected devices as "the cloud." We wonder about car internals only once our vehicle breaks down on the shoulder of a highway.

A final concern with discussing infrastructure is that it is widely perceived as being value-neutral, inert to the considerations of equity, history, textuality, interpretation, and pedagogy that motivate scholars in the humanities. Patrick Svenson has noted a kind of infrastructural agnosia that has existed in the humanities—that, historically, "when it comes to thinking about the humanities in terms of infrastructure, there seems to be a lack of both everyday systemic awareness and extensive critical work" (339). Despite this historical lack of attention, why might the humanities want to consider infrastructure as the subject of critical and hermaneutic analysis?

** Humanities Values on the Margins

In journal articles, posts, and books, a perennial topic of discussion is why we—as a society, as academics, or even as humanities scholars—should care about the humanities. These debates center around whether the humanities should be considered in utilitarian or autotelic terms, how the humanities is relevant (or irrelevant) to modern society, and whether there is a future for the humanities. While the question of the value of the humanities is frequently debated, the question of humanities values is often left to implication. That is to say that there is frequent, and explicit, discussion of why we should care about the humanities, but little on what the humanities cares about.

*************** TODO Get a bunch of sources and think pieces together about why the humanities matter. Stanley Fish and the crew.

This is not, I would argue, because the humanities is unclear about its values. It's relatively safe to say, for example, that the humanities, collectively, cares about promoting diversity, removing asymmetries of power, and resisting corporatization and marketization. The humanities also, though less universally, values effective pedagogy, preservation of history and culture, the dissemination of knowledge to the wider public, and theoretical, textual, and philosophical rigor as applied to critical and interpretive work.

Difficulties emerge not because the humanities is unclear about its values, but because its values become enmeshed in overlapping hierarchies that privilege some kinds of work while placing certain kinds of labor on the margins. Though there are myriad such relationships that differ based on factors such as discipline, institutional factors, and XXX, two value hierarchies have emerged as particularly damaging to the enterprise of the humanities—the privileging  of a relatively narrow research orientation, focused primarily  on interpretive and theoretical work, within the humanities, and the situation of the humanities within a larger framework, frequently market-oriented, set of values in the wider society. These punitive relationships—value-based hierarchies within and without the humanities—have resulted in a situation in which the humanities is positioned in a marginal role in the wider society, and certain forms of humanities practice become marginal even within the humanities itself.

This chapter, like previous chapters, is centered on loci of interaction, lines of interface between the humanities and its subjects on the one hand, and the humanities and the society in which it is enmeshed on the other. As in previous observations on loci of interaction among people with disabilities and their social and physical contexts, many of these concerns might be resolved more comprehensively through advocacy—that is, seeking a broad change in values across the humanities or across society. With that said, a negotiated approach, one concerned with hyperlocal conditions and the practical, largely inescapable challenges faced by humanities practitioners day-to-day, provides another vector for analysis and another lever for action. 

Fundamentally, the question faced by many, if not all, humanities practitioners is how to contend—to stay relevant, to make one's mark—on a society that, by and large, does not share the values of the humanities. Compounding this, many humanities practitioners contend with marginalization enforced by hierarchies of labor within the humanities. Why, then, conceive of these issues, concerned as they are with the expression, transference, and frequent mismatch of values, as questions of infrastructure? Alan Liu, in a draft for the book /Against the Cultural Singularity/,, makes the startling observation that the study of infrastructure has begun to approach the study of culture in furthering comprehension of modern social contexts:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
“infrastructure,” the social-cum-technological milieu that at once enables the fulfillment of human experience and enforces constraints on that experience, today has much of the same scale, complexity, and general cultural impact as the idea of “culture” itself. indeed, it may be that in late modernity when the bulk of life and work occurs in organizational institutions of one kind or another, the experience of infrastructure at institutional scales (undergirded by national or regional infrastructures such as electricity grids and global-scale infrastructures such as the internet) is operationally the experience of “culture.” put another way, the word “infrastructure” can now give us the same kind of general purchase on social complexity that stuart hall, raymond williams, and others sought when they reached for their all-purpose word, “culture.” (Liu)
#+END_QUOTE

Liu's observation about infrastructure as a potentially productive subject for analysis is timely, given that questions of infrastructure—and, importantly, who controls infrastructure—are becoming increasingly relevant. Infrastructure is a concern for the wider society, as publics and the commons make concession after concession to privatization and marketization and forces for stability, such as the fourth estate, are "disrupted." Infrastructural concerns, however, also increasingly obtrude on the day-to-day work of humanists. Perhaps at no other time in history have the humanities been so beholden to corporations and their platforms. Humanities practitioners, allmost universally, perform research on databases controlled by corporations such as ProQuest and Elsevier. We write in Microsoft Word. Many of us, especially in the United States, upload grades and check for plagiarism on Blackboard. Though "edtech" has not permeated higher education as comprehensively as it has teaching in the K-12 sphere, many schools, including the City University of New york, make extensive use of proprietary systems, created by corporations such as Oracle and XXX, that are used for teaching, administration, and handling student data.

While use of corporate platforms for humanities work sometimes reflects creative repurposing or a resistant stance against corporatism, their convenience and ubiquity frequently draw humanities practitioners into compromised relationships of power that sacrifice humanities values while serving  the interests of platform creators. At the same time, the infrastructural traditions we have created and stewarded in the humanities are marginalized, regarded as less valuable due to perceived associations with relatively low-status work in teaching, "service," librarianship, mentorship, IT, or administration. Before exploring ways that humanities practitioners can, and are, moving the theory and practice of infrastructure forward, we should perhaps first consider the dilemmas posed by platformification and labor hierarchy within the humanities.

**  The Threat of Corporate Infrastructure in the Humanities

In 2006, nine board members of /Topology/, anOxford University  mathematical journal published by Elsevier, resigned in protest. In their letter, the researchers wrote:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
As you are well aware, the Editors have been concerned about the price of /Topology/ since Elsevier gained control of the journal in 1994. We believe that the price, in combination with Elsevier’s policies for pricing mathematical journals more generally, has had a significant and damaging effect on /Topology/’s reputation in the mathematical research community, and that this is likely to become increasingly serious and difficult, indeed impossible, to reverse in the future. ... Therefore, with great reluctance and sadness, we have made the difficult decision to resign. (Bridson, et al.)
#+END_QUOTE

The editors of /Topology/ were concerned primarily with the pricing of the journal, which under Elsevier's control, was entirely out of their hands. The 2006 /Topology/ resignation, though not the first indication of discontent among academics with Elsevier and similar publishing enterprises, did coincide with the beginning of the open access movement and an increased consciousness of the strange and exploited position in which the academy has found itself. Elsevier, and other commercial academic publishers such as ProQuest and XXXX, have placed themselves in a position of almost astonishing advantage. The situation has been aptly described, in the context of scientific research, by Stephen Buranyi in a 2017 analysis in /The Guardian/:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Scientists create work under their own direction – funded largely by governments – and give it to publishers for free; the publisher pays scientific editors who judge whether the work is worth publishing and check its grammar, but the bulk of the editorial burden – checking the scientific validity and evaluating the experiments, a process known as peer review – is done by working scientists on a volunteer basis. The publishers then sell the product back to government-funded institutional and university libraries, to be read by scientists – who, in a collective sense, created the product in the first place.
#+END_QUOTE

In 2012, a boycott movement, The Cost of Knowledge, was organized to protest Elsevier. Ofer 17,000 researchers have pledged not to fuel Elsevier's enormous and growing publication empire with their labor, citing exorbitant pricing, the corporation's practice of bundling journals together for greater leverage over libraries,  and its support for SOPA and similar anti-speech measures in service of copyright. 


Tal Yarkoni




More recently, libraries in Sweden and Germany have refused to renew subscriptions in protest of the poor value offered by Elsevier and the disproportionate power wielded by the corporation.

While much impetus for the open access movement has arisen from mathematics and the sciences, the humanities has been similarly affected by proprietary gating of research, and humanities practitioners are increasingly concerned. Over 1500 practitioners from the arts and humanities joined The Cost of Knowledge boycott. Researchers in the humanities are speaking out, including Kathleen Fitzpatrick, who has called for "creating collective, cooperative, scholar-organized and -governed publications on open networks" (/Opening Up Open Access/, 2015), and Martin Paul Eve, whose observation that the humanities research resembles "plants [that] live in dry climates, ... at high altitudes, ... [and] in rocky soil" (ix) gives insight into how monograph-heavy and funding-light disciplines face unique challenges that are not similarly applicable in the sciences. Despite this important work, humanities scholars, including myself, frequently find themselves compelled to publish work, written for little or no compensation, behind paywalls that enrich corporate actors while denying or limiting access to fellow researchers.

Another instance of corporate infrastructure that has stolen, unexamined, into almost every corner of the humanities is Microsoft Word. Word is a /de facto/ standard in the humanities, widely used, and frequently required, for tasks as diverse as submitting a publication or conference proposal, crafting syllabuses, creating curriculum vitae, and turning in coursework. Unlike the difficulties surrounding capture of labor and restriction of research in scholarly publishing, however, use of proprietary tools such as Word is not widely or consistently criticized within the academy. Word is, to draw on Wallace's metaphor, the water in which we swim. Indeed, the application name, as envisioned by Microsoft marketer Rowland Hanson, was intended to evoke the embodiment of the word processor category, preempting even the thought of alternatives:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"Hanson devised the approach to product branding that persists at Microsoft to this day. Each product’s name would be stripped down to its essence, creating the impression that it was the definitive—or the only—product of its type. The only ornamentation would be the Microsoft name, to make sure no one forgot who made it. ... [R]emembers Hanson, “... we wanted our name basically to define the generic.” (Maher)
#+END_QUOTE

*************** TODO Hang a lampshade on the fact that it feels gauche to use hermaneutic methods on a tool

Out of Microsoft's ubiquitous Office product line, three applications—Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Powerpoint, and Microsoft Word—are notable not only for their broad success—described in disquieting terms such as "mindshare" and "market penetration"—but for engendering a kind of rhetorical determinism. These Microsoft applications, used in every industry and walk of life, have not provoked resistance with the same level of organization as other infrastructural concerns such as exploitative and closed practices in academic publishing. This is, perhaps, because we possess the conceptual, cultural, and narratological framework for resisting corporations, but are only now developing the capacity to critically examine tools. Corporations are, at least for now, still composed of people, people whose motives can be called into question. Similarly, cultural works—published writing, film, even sales copy—appear to us transparently as the work of a motivated agent or agents, and can be examined either as the product of their author's intention or as a reflection of the cultural gestalt. The software application, however, is not widely regarded as a work, but as a mere tool. Bringing hermaneutic and critical analysis to bear on Microsoft Word, or any other program, still feels gauche, like penning a heated rebuttal to a shovel. Even a shovel has assumptions built into it—of abailty, of morphology, of intention. Modern software applications, which can and do make many more assumptions and demands on our intention, attention, background, and cognition, should be examined as works of intent, not as artifacts independent of assumptions, intentions, and values.

*************** TODO look of narratology to make sure i'm using the word right above

This is not to say that there has not been critical analysis of tools or that there has been no resistance to Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, only that we are at the beginning stages of developing critical vocabulary for an infrastructural critique, what Patrick Svenson has called an "infrastructural turn." Safiya Noble's /Algorithms of Oppression/, for example, has turned scrutiny toward Google, analysing how "results are ... normalized as believable and often presented as factual" (24). Under the rubric of "critical infrastructure studies," scholars such as Tara McPherson, Matthew K. Gold, Alan Liu, and Patrick Svenson have undertaken the foundational work of a hermaneutics of infrastructure, locating infrastructure's impact on the humanities and interdisciplinary communities of practice within the academy. This recent work, too, has been undergirded by work in platform studies, critical code studies, New Media Studies, and media archeology by scholars such as such as Matthew Kirschenbaum, Lori Emerson, Ian Bogost, and Stephanie Boluk.

Objections to Word, Excel, and PowerPoint have ranged from the ethical and XXX to the aesthetic and practical. One of the most tireless detractors of Microsoft PowerPoint has been Edward Tufte, a statistician, political scientist, and scholar of the visual display of information. In "The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint," Tufte argues that the omnipresent presentation application encourages—and in fact almost demands—shallow, procedural, hierarchical, ritualistic, and bureaucratic thinking:


#+BEGIN_QUOTE
PP convenience for the speaker can be costly to both content and audience. These costs result from the cognitive style characteristic of the standard default PP presentation: foreshortening of evidence and thought, low spatial resolution, a deeply hierarchical single-path structure as the model for organizing every type of content, breaking up narrative and data into slides and minimal fragments, rapid temporal sequencing of thin information rather than focused spatial analysis, conspicuous decoration and Phruff, a preoccupation with format not content, an attitude of commercialism that turns everything into a sales pitch. (2)
#+END_QUOTE

One of Tufte's principal objections to PowerPoint is that its limited information throughput requires presenters to condense ideas into slogans or cryptic fragments and that the ritual of creating a slide deck serves as a substitute for substance. Tufte uses the example of the mismanagement by NASA of the space shuttle Columbia disaster, citing a post-incident report that blamed PowerPoint for imprecision and signal distortion as information moved up the organizational hierarchy. By providing the illusion that analysis had occured when it had not, and by replacing prose reports and other rhetorical constructs more reflective of genuine thought and consideration, PowerPoint presentations siloed knowledge, discouraged real discussion, and stifled the deep insights and distinctions that can only be shared through a paragraph of prose or a table of figures.

These proprietary systems run counter to the values of equity, knowledge creation, and anti-corporatism widely held by humanities practitioners. These corporate intrusions into the humanities should raise both ethical and practical objections. Take, for example, Elsevier.

human ties doesn't reach out or connect with folk humanities / folk hermaneutics

the unhuman elemnt is explicitly trying to replace culture with technological infrastrcture:
- block chain / trustless
- replace conversations with technoology (google duplex or whatever)

can haccessibility  help here? just as we must replace bad culture with good culture, we must replace bad infrastrcture with good infrastructure

:end:


** We Had Infrastructure
the humanities had all sorts of infrastructure that we created ourselves. we should think of it as important and think how we can preserve and translate this infrastrcture

to preserve this infrastrcture we need to stop thinking of certain humantiies work as not important. think librarianship

** humanities values not reflected in the wder society
** humanities values not reflected in the way we do our work
** some dhers are thinking about infrastrcture
** more importantly, some dhers are making infrastructure
** what if the humanities were a public resource?
what would it look like?
there were visions: dram machines and the memex


** can the humanities attend to negotiation, point of intersection?
we would have to rethink:
- public engagement
- research
- publication
- teaching? this might actually be ok but materials?

haccessibility approach is one that makes it easy to go the last mile and do stuff
forkable curriclum for dri lets people iterate on things without too much technical knowledge
google docs gets the usability right but sucks at all the things we care about...provenance, owning your own stuff (what's the point of tenure if google can unpublish your stuff?), sustainability
** who is building infrastructure?
** if we're doing infrastrcture, are we doing humanities?

“We demonstrated that the Web had failed instead of served humanity, as it was supposed to have done, and failed in many places,” he told me. The increasing centralization of the Web, he says, has “ended up producing—with no deliberate action of the people who designed the platform—a large-scale emergent phenomenon which is anti-human.”

* Introduction

Consider yourself, for a moment, from the outside. You open a door, put on your shoes, move a chair to where you will need it. Or you speak with a friend, hit send on an important email, give a talk to your gathered colleagues. Imagine, briefly, that your act is something concrete—a weight in the world, a drawn thread, a radiating light, or a shared breath. This moment, or this act, is an encounter. You push on the world, and the world pushes back. There is you, and there is everything else. But, fleetingly, there is a space between.

This project is about /negotiation/—this encounter, this space or surface, between an individual and the immediate physical and social environment. Though all people negotiate their physical environments, and negotiate with others in their social environments, /Negotiated Access/ is primarily concerned about people with disabilities and their—our—negotiation in a world that is largely not built with us in mind. Here, our fundamental concern is with the local—or hyperlocal—as embedded in the universal. How can particularity—the needs, autonomy, and values of an individual or affinity group—survive when embedded in environments in which physical and social structures, even identities, are constructed for others and not for us?

/Negotiated Access/ begins with the hyperlocal and radiates outward. Chapter One opens with a blind individual's dogged effort to complete a game created for, and only accessible to, the sighted. The chapter explores the implications of this and similar actions, and in the process makes use of a negotiated model of disability that attends not to bodies or the broader society, but the point or surface of interaction between the two. In discussing a negotiated model of disability, Chapter One also introduces the concept of "haccessibility," or the use of hyperlocal adaptations or workarounds to overcome specific obstacles in the built and social environment. Though these adaptations can be celebrated, they are also limited. These limitations highlight the hostility of the built and social environment to people with disabilities, and this negotiated model is intended to augment a social model that advocates for change in the broader society.

here are two aspects to power. The first aspect is what the German philosopher Rainer Forst in 2014 defined as ‘the capacity of A to motivate B to think or do something that B would otherwise not have thought or done’. The means through which the powerful enact their influence are varied. They include motivational speeches, recommendations, ideological descriptions of the world, seduction and credible threats. Forst argues that brute force or violence is not an exercise of power, for subjected people don’t ‘do’ anything; rather, something is done to them. But clearly brute force is an instance of power. It is counterintuitive to think of someone as powerless who is subjecting us through violence. Think of an army dominating a population, or a thug strangling you. In Economy and Society (1978), the German political economist Max Weber describes this second aspect of power as the ability for people and institutions to ‘carry out [their] own will despite resistance’.

* Introducing Negotiated Access
** Terry Garrett
On May 8, 2011, a blind gamer named Terry Garrett began playing /Zelda: The Ocarina of Time/. The game, widely considered a classic, depicts a 3D world populated with puzzles, enemies, and difficult terrain. It also offers no intentional concessions to a blind player using only sound cues, memory, and dogged persistence to navigate the game world. 

Five years later, Garrett completed his playthrough. Using binaural audio, he had found that he could map entities and terrain in the environment. Inaudible features could be struck with objects to produce identifying sounds, and a combination of trial-and-error and external research allowed him to pass traps and solve puzzles.

What conception of disability allows us to best understand Garrett's achievement? Two models have come to dominate narratives of and advocacy for disability. The first, the medical model, sees disability as a personal tragedy that can be resolved only by a cure or by mitigation from the medical community. Implicit in this perspective is the assumption that disability is a social aberration, a condition that must be cured or obscured. The social model of disability, on the other hand, envisions disability as a societal concern, and contends that most negative outcomes from disability stem from the ignorance, indifference, or bias of the wider, largely able, community. Proponents of the social model seek attitudinal and public policy changes to eliminate difficulties associated with stigma and a lack of understanding about disabled lives.

How well do these models address the challenges faced by Garrett as he, a blind gamer, engaged with a creation designed without knowledge of his circumstances? The solutions offered by the medical model offer only a binary outcome. Either Garrett's disability is cured or ameliorated, allowing him to engage with the game in the socially prescribed way, or it is not. If no cure is forthcoming, then the medical model of disability is silent, offering no further recourse. Under the medical model, therefore, the challenge Garrett has set for himself could only be regarded as an impossibility.

The social model has far more to offer. In the last few years, communication among disabled gamers and developers has led to the release of a small but notable list of games in formats accessible to those with mobility and sensory disabilities. This brief list, which has included titles such as /Skull Girls/ and /King of Dragon Pass/, has shown that awareness and advocacy can led to concrete change even in gaming, a community that is often explicitly ableist in its outlook and rhetoric. However, though notable, these successes have been limited in scope. The overwhelming majority of games and game developers do not consider the needs of mobility- and sensory-impaired gamers, and many developers who become aware of specific disabilities argue that it's simply impossible for them to adapt their games for those with disabilities such as missing limbs or blindness. Even disabilities that are common and relatively simple to mitigate in games, such as color blindness, have received only limited attention. Further, widely used platforms that must be navigated to access games in the first place, such as the menus on the Playstation 4 console or the Steam game distribution service for PC, remain inaccessible, even in the face of an ADA ruling that requires that, at minimum, the communications and chat features in games must be made accessible.

*************** END

When considering Garrett's struggle to complete a game designed exclusively for sighted players, it's clear—and unsurprising to those following disability studies—that the perspective provided by the social model is more productive than that provided by the medical model. While the medical establishment would have little or no interest in Garrett's experience as a case study, the social model suggests ways that society could change to better accommodate the goals of Garrett and other disabled gamers. Were developers in games to equip menus with audio or voice cues, for example, gamers like Garrett would not be forced to memorize interfaces through trial and error or with sighted assistance.[fn:making-games-accessible] Despite the salience of the social model to Garrett's experience, however, there is an aspect—a critical aspect—of his effort that falls outside the usual scope of the social model as we know it.

[fn:making-games-accessible] My point here is that the current state of gaming is, by and large, not accessible, and that it makes sense for gamers with disabilities to look outside of advocacy for ways to pursue their aims in the present. However, I do not want to understate the progress taking place in this area or the potential long-term importance of changes brought about by advocacy.

Developments in this area have included accessibility initiatives by gaming-adjacent communities such as LEGO citep:kacala_legos_2019 and the incorporation of combination optical character recognition and screen reader functionality features into game emulator platforms citep:matteis_retroarch_2019. A number of mainstream games have implemented accessibility-related features such as color blind and large font modes, and a handful, such as Madden 2018, have taken steps toward playability for the fully blind citep:electronic_arts_madden_2018. Some more serious projects, such as the Accessible Player Experiences (APX) initiative by nonprofit AbleGamers, appear to have enough impetus to potentially move the needle on attitudes toward accessibility. 

Finally, due perhaps to FCC rules that went into effect in 2015 mandating that certain game console functionality be made accessible, there has been an uptick in researcher interest in the challenges associated with creating accessible games [[citep:garber_game_2013][p. 17]] and a growing awareness of the central role of gaming in culture, therapy, and education [[citep:yuan_game_2011][p. 2]]. Though these developments are exciting, advocacy around changing attitudes toward accessibility in gaming is still in its early stages.

** A Negotiated Model of Disability

The disabled experience is typically—though not universally—characterized by distinct relationships between the individual and the lived environment. Consider the cane, an implement that, in its differing forms, is almost metanymous with mobility and sensory disabilities. For the blind and for many who are mobility impaired, the cane is an emblem of independence. When picking up a cane, the relationship among certain disabled individuals and their lived environment is powerfully altered. Distances shrink and senses expand. Daniel Kish, an advocate for unorthodox mobility strategies for the blind, describes the experience:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Now, moving forward, how do I manage today? ... Fortunately, I have my trusty long cane, longer than the canes used by most blind people. I call it my freedom staff. (Kish, 2015)
#+END_QUOTE
Yet the cane, and the myriad other rhetorical, physical, cognitive, and emotional strategies deployed by people with disabilities, are not cures. Their use and deployment is necessarily idiosyncratic, unique to specific disabled individuals and their affinity groups. Their use or presence also often visibly sets disabled individuals apart. Unlike the medical cure, which seeks to normalize pathology and efface difference, the myriad strategies deployed by disabled people to negotiate physical and cultural spaces are a source of difference. This difference is primarily one of perception, altering both how people with disabilities perceive society and the built environment and how others perceive them in turn.

Yet while we know that the medical model often fails to address or encompass disabled experience, the social model, for all its importance and usefulness, is perhaps more effective as a tool for advocacy on a large scale than as a means through which to grapple with the subjective experience of living with a specific disability. Tom Shakespeare offers a considered, and highly nuanced, appraisal of the strengths and weaknesses of the social model. In his analysis, the comprehensibility of the fundamental idea behind the social model—that disability results from barriers put in place by society—makes it an ideal tool for activism, including the breaking down of specific social barriers. Secondarily, the social model allows for a change in affect: "It is not the disabled person who is to blame, but society. She does not have to change, society does. Rather than feeling self-pity, she can feel anger and pride" (Shakespeare, 2013, p. 217). Shakespeare contends that the primary strength of the social model—its straightforward comprehensibility—makes it less desirable as an academic account of disability. Further, its articulation by a highly specific group—white, heterosexual men, primarily with disabilities of mobility and primarily in Britain, calls into question its ability to represent the full spectrum of experiences with disability. Shakespeare is in agreement with Liz Crow, who argues that,

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[a]s individuals, most of us simply cannot pretend with any conviction that our impairments are irrelevant because they influence every aspect of our lives. We must find a way to integrate them into our whole experience and identity for the sake of our physical and emotional well-being, and, subsequently, for our capacity to work against Disability (Crow, 1992, p. 7)
#+END_QUOTE

My own experiences with disability lead me to agree with the perspectives offered by Shakespeare and Crow. The social model, as important and useful as it is, should be expanded, at least in contexts outside of activism, to be sensitive to the full gamut of disabled experience, a range that includes chronic pain and conditions that may result in early death.

In this project, I offer another imperfect model, a negotiated model of disability, intended to augment the social model and move toward a more holistic understanding of disability. I offer it for the same reason the social model was offered: to provide understanding of a specific aspect of the disabled experience in order to break down barriers and allow for greater autonomy and independence. In later chapters, I also articulate how a negotiated model can speak to larger questions of expressing values in contexts where essential infrastructure and cultural understanding are not present. As with any model, I do not believe we should view the world exclusively through the lens of negotiation. Yet by focusing not on the body exclusively (the medical model) or macro-scale society (a common articulation of the social model), but on the interplay between the individual and the immediate social and built environment, I believe that one can reach a set of new conclusions and, in doing so, break down a set of old barriers, barriers different from those targeted in activism supported by the social model. These conclusions, essentially, revolve around a single idea: that individuals, and by extension local communities of practice, should be able to have autonomy over their immediate environment. When put this way, the proposition sounds agreeable and, perhaps, even simple. Yet nothing could be less simple, and this project attempts to contend with that reality. The forces arrayed against even the merest individual autonomy and self-determination are numerous. These forces, unthinking and unfeeling but purposeful and relentless, are like the Moloch of Alan Ginsberg's /Howl/: "Moloch whose mind is pure machinery! Moloch whose blood is running money! ... Moloch whose breast is a cannibal dynamo! ... Moloch whose factories dream and croak in the fog! Moloch whose smoke-stacks and antennae crown the cities! ... They broke their backs lifting Moloch to Heaven!" (Ginsberg, 1955). Whether or not one feels the encroachment of the unhuman, Empire, technopoly, or Moloch at the periphery of one's existence, this project, and the negotiated model, attempts to contend with forces that make the locus of control remote, rather than local; centralized, rather than federated; and in processes, rather than people.

The negotiated model argues that, in raising a cane—or in lip reading, using a screen reader, or adapting a vehicle to a mobility impairment——the disabled individual asserts a kind of power that does not flow from their approval or status in the wider community. Simultaneously, they assert their own identity, both individually and as part of an affinity group. Drawing on their understanding of their own situation and their relationship with the lived environment, the disabled individual /negotiates/. That is, they negotiate their environment, altering or recontextualizing connections between their own body and the physical world. They negotiate with others, learning to survive in social milieus often characterized by ignorance and hostility. They share, build, and teach amongst themselves, creating negotiables—knowledge, physical infrastructure, and social capital that are their own. These practices are universal and critical to survival but are often invisible and unacknowledged.

Models of disability combine a means of conceiving of or envisioning disability with a prescribed way forward—that is, a way of improving—or attempting to improve—the lives of disabled people. For the medical model, this prescribed way forward is the cure, an effacement of disability. For the social model, the way forward is social change in the wider society, including advocacy for and understanding of the lives of disabled people. In articulating and exploring a third model, the negotiated model, intended to augment the critical work already done under the aegis of the social model. Like existing models of disability, this model provides both a way to conceive of and situate disability and a way forward, a means of improving the lives of disabled people.

The negotiated model articulated here is not simply a call for new types of work to be done to improve the lives of people with disabilities, especially given that negotiated forms of access have been, and continue to be, practiced by individuals and communities in myriad forms. This model of access has, however, been underexamined in the context of disability studies and in the academy more widely. A goal of this project, therefore, is to focus attention on excellent work that is, and that arguably has always been, underway by practitioners in the wider disability community, and to provide a framework to better understand and contextualize this labor. Further, this project seeks to connect a theoretical understanding of negotiated access to related work in other domains. These connections include the digital humanities, with its emphasis on critical making and infrastructure, and utopian studies, which explores alternative relationships among bodies and their environments. Just as applications of the social model of disability have advanced discourses in a variety of disciplines, the negotiated model of disability can contribute to a wider understanding of affinity groups that develop practices, knowledges, and infrastructure that push back against complicit orthodoxy and normalizing forces.

So, again: what conception of disability allows us to best understand Garrett's achievement—completing, independently as a blind individual, a game designed exclusively for the sighted? If it's not yet clear, my answer to this question is the negotiated model of disability. While advocacy and social progress on the rights of disabled gamers might have helped, and could yet help, individuals such as Garrett, it was not this form of social progress that allowed Garrett to overcome this challenge. It also goes without saying that no (entirely theoretical) cure contributed to his victory. Rather, Garrett's accomplishment was the result of a successful negotiation of the lived environment. In approaching an apparently inaccessible game as he did, Garrett forced a redefinition of his relationship with it, creating infrastructure—a path—where no infrastructure existed before. Garrett's achievement also shares many characteristics of negotiated access that will be discussed in depth in this chapter, among them an idiosyncratic, exploratory, or free-form approach to the creation of localized infrastructure—"haccessability."

Finally, it's essential to note that negotiated access is not an exceptional or extraordinary state for disabled individuals. Rather, it's a daily, or even hourly, fact of life. Case studies such as Garrett's and the others that will be discussed below garner focus and attention in both disabled and non-disabled communities, making them attractive for citation, discussion, and inclusion in a text such as this one. For disabled individuals, however, negotiation of the lived environment is simply a fact of life, one generally performed without fanfare or even, in most cases, acknowledgment. In addition, those individuals whose achievements come to wider public attention are often, despite their disabled status, privileged in other ways. While this study will attempt to balance extraordinary examples of negotiated access with those in keeping with the daily struggles and successes of disabled life, I wish to acknowledge that "notable" achievements in this context are unfortunately often those marked out by able, rather than disabled, communities. To the extent that it is possible within the bounds of this project, I have sought out firsthand accounts and voices of disabled experience whenever possible.

** What Is Negotiated Access?

Negotiated Access is advocacy, knowledge creation , and the building of infrastructure that begins within an affinity group and radiates outward. It's rooted in the lived experience of people with disabilities and its locus is the idiosyncratic capabilities, skills, and practices that enable people with disabilities to survive and (sometimes) flourish in an able and ableist society. Negotiated Access addresses aspects of the disabled experience that are marginal or underacknowledged within current paradigms, particularly methods that do not rely on, or defy, the approval or approbation of the wider society. In some cases, negotiation may require, or involve, passing—temporarily merging with the perception of the dominant able class to extract withheld support or necessary acknowledgement or concessions. At other times, negotiation involves practices that are considered asocial, resistant, or antisocial by the wider able community. Negotiation, therefore, tends to be at the periphery of the disabled experience, in the actions that are not easily narrativized or made legible by the community at large, but which are a means of survival for individuals and their affinity groups.

Gene Bellinger, a theorist of systems, defines a model as a "simplification of reality intended to promote understanding" citep:bellinger_model_2004. The limitations that apply to all models—that the map, however useful an aid to understanding, cannot reflect the full territory—also apply to models of disability—perhaps especially so, given the myriad manifestations of disability and disabled identity. Indeed, one practitioner's social model—or medical model, individual model, charity model, administrative model—may, and quite frequently does, differ in application and interpretation when invoked by another. Mike Oliver, said to have coined the term "social model," has gone to lengths to frame it as a "practical tool, not a theory, an idea or a concept" [[citep:oliver_social_2004][p. 19]]. Oliver contends that too much effort has gone into debating the applicability of paradigms and models to the phenomenon of disability and not enough effort into actually bringing about change: "If we imagine that throughout human history the carpenters and builders of the world had spent their time talking about whether the hammer was an adequate tool for the purpose of building houses, we would still be living in caves" [[citep:oliver_social_2004][p. 20]]. Here, Oliver is—pun intended—blunt with his analysis, and in my opinion there is clear value in theorizing disability in all its complexity. Ultimately, however, my interest in models, including a negotiated model, comes from my own individual experiences with disability and my participation in, and regard for, communities of individuals who view disability as part of their identity. In speaking of a negotiated model, I have little interest in imposing specific narratives on the complexity that is disability, but every interest in understanding specific aspects of the disabled experience. Like any model of disability, or indeed any model, thinking of disability in terms of negotiation is intended to be useful, but not totalizing or proscriptive.

While negotiated access flows from the personal and the idiosyncratic in the lives of people with disabilities, as a practice and as a critical lens it is also a vector for political and cultural energy. As we will see in later chapters, negotiated access throws light on disability as an identity and the relationships among disability affinity groups, the narrativization of disability in media, the rise of transhumanism and the pathologization of humanity, the articulation of values through infrastructure, the implications of proprietary and commercial ideologies on the body, and the imagination and implementation of crip utopias. Negotiated access, and related concepts such as haccessibility, suggest ways we can advance both on-the-ground advocacy in the disabled community and augment our understanding of disability through the lens of the social model. Closely examining the unidealized, day-to-day interactions among disabled people and society, however, also raises a host of theoretical questions, not only about disabled life but also about how society at large reflects, or fails to reflect, our values.

** Jaywalking Past Obstacles

Meagan H. Houle, a communications specialist and disability rights blogger, uses a metaphor—waiting on the curb for a ride—to describe her experience of being blocked by society's neglect of essential accommodations:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Being disabled, I realized, is a lot of standing on the corner, waiting for the world to decide that it’s safe for you to cross. My life as a disabled person involves a lot of standing still, watching cars fly freely by, wondering when the light will turn green long enough for me to make some headway. Since the system is more complicated than I can wrap my head around, and there’s no handy countdown, I have no clear idea when that might happen. So I wait, getting increasingly cold and impatient, for a path forward. Some days, it feels as though the world is filled with cars, and I am the only pedestrian in sight. They are roaring along while I walk and wait, walk and wait. citep:houle_wait!_2018
#+END_QUOTE
Houle's experience of living with a disability is not a consistent one—in her metaphor, she contrasts her waiting with stretches of progress long enough to cause her to forget her own time spent blocked by a lack of accommodation: "Barriers are overcome, and my journey picks up speed. ... The reprieve might even be long enough for me to point at other unlucky foot travelers, and to wonder loudly what they've done—or left undone—to leave themselves stranded at the corner" citep:houle_wait!_2018. However, at points in this metaphorical journey when she is blocked for too long to bear, when the contrast between her lack of progress and others' ease of travel becomes too great, Houle describes another way forward:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Then, when the waiting becomes too much for me, I try to jaywalk. I barge right into the unsafe spaces, the heavy traffic, the uncharted territory. I might get a warning or a slap on the wrist or even an angry honk from someone’s horn; occasionally, I retreat to my corner, chastened. I am foolish and fragile. I must be protected from myself citep:houle_wait!_2018
#+END_QUOTE
Houle's comparison to jaywalking, part of a larger metaphor that grapples with the subjective experience of living with disability, describes an almost involuntary reaction to suppression, a reaction born of anger and frustration. This reaction, I will argue, is not only understandable—facing injustice by ignoring or circumventing constraints imposed by commercial interests, majoritarian apathy, or social propriety can help bring about lasting change. My own feelings echo Houle's benediction to the coming generation, that "when the time comes to jaywalk, to break the rules and challenge the status quo, they will have the courage to do it, and the good fortune to emerge triumphant" citep:houle_wait!_2018.

** Cementing the Future

Houle's metaphor—waiting on a corner for change, jaywalking past obstacles—is particularly fitting in light of a history of civil disobedience by disability rights activists, many of whom, in the 60s and 70s, were explicitly concerned with the inaccessibility of streets and street corners. One incident—the quiet reshaping at night of particular street corners to make them accessible by wheelchair—has been mythologized in the retelling. 

In 1962, Ed Roberts, a quadriplegic polio survivor, became the first student at Berkeley with a profound disability. Roberts had to overcome a series of obstacles to enroll, among them securing dormitory space for his 800-pound iron lung. Famously, a dean at the university reportedly claimed that "[w]e’ve tried cripples before and it didn’t work" citep:dawson_ed_2015. Over the next decade, Roberts and a growing circle of activists with disabilities would create the Center for Independent Living, a community that advocated for students with disabilities on campus and which would prove instrumental in the burgeoning disability rights movement. In the early years of the Center, however, Roberts was faced with a critical issue: a lack of curb cuts on street corners made it difficult to organize and attend meetings.[fn:curb-cuts]

[fn:curb-cuts] Curb cuts, the small ramps or "cuts" in the sidewalk at almost every modern street corner, are generally taken for granted by the public. Before the rise of the disability rights movement in the 1960s, curbs on corners were generally raised about six inches off the street, making every block a barrier to those using wheelchairs. Between 1970-1974, largely in response to advocacy by the Independent Living Movement, Berkeley created the first accessible wheelchair route in the United States, and by 1990 the passing of the Americans with Disabilities Act mandated curb cuts on all street corners. 

The fact that curb cuts are so useful to every member of the community, not just those with disabilities, means they are frequently held up as a fundamental example of Universal Design, a philosophy or methodology that considers accessibility to be a normal and integrated part of any design process citep:williamson_peoples_2012, and the term "curb cut effect" is sometimes used to describe changes made for disadvantaged groups that ultimately benefit the wider society [[citep:glover_blackwell_curb-cut_2017][p. 28]].
# End footnote
# End footnote !!!!!


Ultimately, the activities and advocacy of the Independent Living Movement would result in the creation of one of the first accessible wheelchair routes in the United States. Before these systemic changes took place years later, however, Roberts still needed to move around Berkeley. As a temporary solution, and in an act of civil disobedience, a number of individuals connected to the Independent Living Movement went out into the streets at night and, with bags of cement, created ramps when no ramps had existed before.

In an interview for an oral history of the independent living movement at Berkeley, Eric Dibner, a friend and sometime medical attendant for Roberts, describes the mythos that sprung up around this guerilla modification of street corners. The following is an excerpt from a conversation between Dibner and interviewer Kathy Cowan recorded in 1997-1998 as part of the Disability Rights and Independent Living Movement Project, an initiative that created an extensive oral history of the period.


#+BEGIN_QUOTE
# Dibner

# ... so that was one of my first experiences with ramps, right, and learning that if you're closer to the ground, you don't have to build so much of a ramp, like, duh! [laughs]


Cowan (interviewer)

I certainly have heard your name associated with ramps over and over again, Eric. There is this story that you were building curb cuts and ramps in Berkeley sort of unofficially. Is there a story behind that?


Eric Dibner

Well, you didn't hear about the nitroglycerin where we were blowing up curbs and [laughter] and jackhammers in the middle of the night, where we'd go and we'd jackhammer up all these intersections and then the city would have to fix them.


Cowan (interviewer)

No, I didn't hear that story. Is that a true story? [laughs]


Eric Dibner

No, neither of those are true stories, actually. [laughs] That was a little later when Ed [Roberts] asked for some ramps to be--there were some corners where he had problems going from his house to CIL, or maybe it was the Disabled Students' Program. So I got a bag of cement and went out. They were real low curbs, like a couple of inches, at Dana and Dwight, probably at Ellsworth and Dwight, and I think I did one at Ellsworth and Blake. It was just to bevel the corner. I mean, we didn't build curb ramps, we just put some cement down to make it useable. [[citep:bancroft_library_regional_oral_office_builders_2000][p. 24]]
#+END_QUOTE

As can be seen in the above exchange, the intervention made here by Eric Dibner and others was at once a practical solution to an immediate problem, a provocation to those representing the status quo, and a galvanizing act. Ed Roberts, a critical individual in the Independent Living Movement, needed to get to meetings, and get to meetings /now/​—not years later when the city was finally convinced to create a route. The cement corners also served as a demonstration, a statement of how things should be, an eloquent way to say that the corner /should just have a ramp/. Perhaps most importantly, however, this intervention, this infrastructural end-run, provided a rallying point, creating the kind of story around which a movement could crystallize. This can be seen in how the act was remembered not as a mere bevel, an addition to the curb, but as an act of demolition, of clearing away the old order and forcing a new way of doing things. As the mythology around this incident shows, interventions such as these occupy their own psychological and social space. They create a history, a narrative, that paves the way, figuratively speaking, for greater social change. The dramatization of Dibner's small reshaping of Berkeley infrastructure, transforming a bag of cement into jackhammers and nitroglycerin in the popular imagination, shows the need for images of resistance that galvanize activists, shame adherents to the status quo, and show why change is necessary—and what it might look like in practice.

Dibner's intervention is a powerful example of what I'll call /haccessibility/​—essentially, the use of hacking or a hacking ethos to make things accessible, with or without the approval of the broader society. Haccessibility is a radical form of negotiation, a redrawing of the boundary between the self and the physical and social environment. Though acts of haccessibility frequently take the form of an individual seeking greater autonomy, they often serve as a first step toward the creation of useful infrastructure or a provocation with the potential to lead to social change. Thus, haccessibility is important not only for redrawing boundaries between an individual and the immediate environment, but also for catalyzing change that can spread to an affinity group and, possibly, to the broader society.

** Something in the Air

It is no coincidence that these interventions—not just Dibner's actions with a bag of cement, but the Independent Living and the broader Disability Rights movement—took place in the 1960s and 1970s. This work resonates, and was informed by, other movements underway at that time. The parallels with the first, the Civil Rights Movement, were clear to early disability rights advocates who followed its model of civil disobedience, including the use of peaceful demonstrations and sit-ins. Similarly, disability rights advocates in this period also participated in other political movements, such as the nascent environmental movement, including occupation of wetlands in support of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act [[citep:bancroft_library_regional_oral_office_builders_2000][p. 279]]. 

Something, clearly, was in the air—or the water—of the California of the 60s and early 70s, the counterculture giving rise to the civil rights movement, second-wave feminism, the disability rights movement, the anti-war movement, the Beat Generation, psychedelia, and the early environmental movement, among many others. In this period, too, great changes were taking place in the field of technology and, in particular, computers and computer culture. The early days of computer culture were also largely focused around the same places, especially the Bay Area and on college campuses. In /What the Dormouse Said/, an account of the rise of computing in the 60s, John Marko shows how counterculture ideology influenced the nascent tech scene. Figures such as Stewart Brand, best known for the /Whole Earth Catalog/, XXX were deeply influenced by both the counterculture and the early tech scene, and the rhetoric, if perhaps not the purpose or spirit, of the counterculture was adopted wholesale by Silicon Valley startups such as Apple.[fn:apple-counterculture]

[fn:apple-counterculture] One can read about the hippie aesthetic and sensibility that colored the life of Steve Jobs, including his love of yoga, in a number of relatively anodyne biographies and accounts citep:dormehl_apple_2013,isaacson_steve_2011 . Perhaps more interesting is Žižek's incisive take on the category of what he calls "liberal communist," the now-familiar Silicon Valley disrupter type: "Liberal communists are big executives recuperating the spirit of contest, or, to put it the other way round, countercultural geeks who take over big corporations. Their dogma is a new, postmodernised version of Adam Smith’s old invisible hand of the market. Market and social responsibility here are not opposites. They can be reunited for mutual benefit" [[citep:zizek_violence:_2008][p. 17]]. 

The height (or perhaps the nadir) of "Apple as revolution" rhetoric may well be the famous 1984 commercial, directed with dystopian verve by Ridley Scott, that intones: "[o]n January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you'll see why 1984 won't be like `1984'" citep:scott_1984_1984.

I'll largely be drawing a distinction between the hacker archetype and the disruptor archetype. There is significant overlap here, however, especially in disruptors self-identifying as hackers, and I acknowledge that these distinctions may skirt the "no true Scotsman" fallacy.

There are a number of historical points of connection between early computing culture and the disability rights movement, mostly beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s. An early, and notable, connection arose out of a chance in-flight meeting in 1974 between a blind man and Ray Kurzweil, a young inventor who had just patented a new method for optical character recognition[fn:ocr]. Kurzweil, who had just invented a solution that was in search of a problem, learned that OCR and speech synthesis might be of use to people with impairments to vision and, later, mobility [[citep:petrick_making_2015][p. 2]]. After seeing a demonstration on television, Stevie Wonder became the second owner of the Kurzweil Reader, the device that followed from this encounter. Kurzweil is now most strongly associated with the futurist and transhumanist movements, having written books such as /The Age of Intelligent Machines/ and /The Singularity Is Near/. Among his beliefs are that technology will fully accommodate, and ultimately cure, all disabilities, and that this is only one step in the move toward the "singularity," the point at which technological development will experience exponential growth. In the last chapter of this project, I'll examine the transhumanist ideology in greater detail and argue that the philosophy is representative of an emergent social, cognitive, and technological superstructure that pathologizes humanity, flattens difference, and elevates system. Though Kurzweil's inventions have doubtless helped many, he also embodies the dangers of infrastructure created by outsiders to a community and technological solutions that encourage dependence rather than independence.

Though the fact that much of the disability rights and early computing movements developed in roughly the same time and many of the same places is suggestive of some useful parallels, I do not wish to overstate the historical connections between these communities. Rather, in invoking haccessibility as a concept, I wish to explicitly compare the values and practices of disabled practitioners with a specific subculture, that of hackers and hacking. In the next section, we'll explore historical and contemporary understandings of "hack" and "hacker," controversial terms that can mean quite different things in different contexts. The hacker ethos as sometimes articulated elevates autonomy, resilience, and collaboration within small affinity groups, values that I perceive in action in many disabled communities of practice. Perhaps more importantly, the hacker ethos provides a mode of resistance, focused as it is on understanding, subverting, and repurposing systems. As we will explore in Chapter 3, people with disabilities stand outside the social and infrastructural norm, requiring that they create their own infrastructure and local community. The rest of this chapter will examine the hacker ethos and draw attention to modes of resistance and creation that can be seen in current and historical communities of people with disabilities.

** What Is a Hacker?

"Hacker" is a contested term, one with a set of meanings and associations highly dependent on context and culture. For most, the hacker is figured as a modern-day boogieman or, at best, a trickster. In the news, depictions of the hacker have shifted from a suburban adolescent capable of bringing about nuclear Armageddon to a faceless assortment of criminal collectives to, more recently, the chosen tool of adversarial state actors for subverting Western institutions. Casually and less consistently, individuals in government, corporations, or other positions of power may use the term "hacker" to delegitimize whistleblowers who exfiltrate data, such as Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden, or researchers who point out security vulnerabilities created by technical or policy decisions on the part of corporations or the government. In fiction, especially film and television, the hacker appears as an unreliable guide or, tamed, clears impediments from the path of the protagonist.

The original use of the word "hacker," one that survives to this day in a number of subcultures, is quite different from this popular figuration. The terms "hack" and "hacker" originated at MIT in the early 1960s amongst a group of technically-minded students, many of whom participated in MIT's Tech model train club, the AI lab, or both.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The core members hung out at the club for hours; constantly improving The System, arguing about what could be done next, developing a jargon of their own that seemed incomprehensible to outsiders who might chance on these teen-aged fanatics [...]. [...] one who insisted on studying for courses was a "tool"; garbage was called "cruft"; and a project undertaken or a product built not solely to fulfill some constructive goal, but with some wild pleasure taken in mere involvement, was called a "hack." [[citep:levy_hackers:_2010][p. 8]]
#+END_QUOTE
For these early hackers, the word "hack" already had a number of related usages. One could "hack away" on a task or project, artlessly expending effort but making progress. One might implement a "quick hack," a suspect or unreliable solution that solves a problem in the short term. Most important, however, was the "excellent hack"—a striking or even transcendent solution that demonstrated intimate familiarity or mastery of a system.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
But as the TMRC [Tech Model Railroad Club] people used the word, there was serious respect implied. While someone might call a clever connection between relays a "mere hack," it would be understood that, to qualify as a hack, the feat must be imbued with innovation, style, and technical virtuosity. [...] The most productive people working on Signals and Power called themselves "hackers" with great pride. (Levy, 1984, p. 8)
#+END_QUOTE

Hackers, in this early use of the word, were those who worked on a problem—often technical—out of passion rather than obligation, and who sought a deep understanding of a system or domain. This early hacker culture valued "playful cleverness" (Stallman, 2002), collaborative work, and the sharing of resources and results. 

# They also frequently flouted rules, procedures, and restrictions on access, often in attempts to gain a commodity that, at the time, was highly valuable and frequently out of reach—computer time. 

*************** DONE How did the term "hacker" come to mean criminal?
		CLOSED: [2020-10-31 Sat 14:18]
*************** END

Much ink has been spilled over the relative legitimacy of various definitions of the word "hacker," particularly whether the term should be applied to criminals who gain unauthorized access to computers or curious and playful technophiles. Hackers who connect themselves to the subculture that originated at MIT often attempt to distance themselves from the more widespread usage, insisting that hackers who specialize in gaining access to computer systems be called "crackers" instead. This effort, by and large, has been unsuccessful, and the ambiguity surrounding the word "hacker" remains. In comparing elements of hacker culture to the concerns and practices of the disabled community, however, I will treat each of these interpretations of the term as legitimate. Therefore, the term "haccessibility" as it is used in this project draws on both the tradition of the hacker as playful, deeply skilled amateur and hacker as a specialist in gaining or preventing unauthorized access to systems.

There is a great deal to laud in the hacker ethos, at least as idealized, and this project will largely focus on that which is most useful in the subculture. However, I will try to avoid giving undue credit to the hacker. The notional hacker is an ambiguous figure, and real-life hackers frequently fall short of even this qualified ideal. Modern hackers focused on computer security self-categorize into "black hats," "white hats," and, occasionally, "gray hats," depending on the type and legality of their work.[fn:black-hat-white-hat] Though some black hats are whistleblowers, hacktivists, or Robin Hood types, many or most are simply criminals without higher motivations. Though white hats as a class may seem easier to defend, their increasing situation in corporations[fn:boardroom-bedroom] and government can, in many cases, render them merely employees upholding the status quo rather than agents of resistance. Old-school hackers of the builder and tinkerer variety also have notable failings and shortcomings. In 2018, Linus Torvalds, the creator of the free and open source Linux operating system, voluntarily stepped away from the project due to a pattern of verbally abusive behavior in his work with volunteers. In 2019, Richard Stallman, who will receive attention in the next section as the originator of the free software movement, was forced to step down from his public-facing roles due to controversial statements made on a mailing list. Though the ethos of the hacker is powerful and useful for understanding specific modes of creation and resistance, it is worth noting that, in practice, the hacker community can be destructive, exclusory, and unselfreflective.[fn:highwaymen]

[fn:black-hat-white-hat] The terms come from Western genre films in which "good guys" wore white hats and "bad guys" wore black hats. Perhaps the best-known conference in the field of hacking is simply called "Black Hat."

[fn:boardroom-bedroom] A 2011 article in the industry publication /Network Security/ declared, "for practitioners who have kept to the straight and narrow ... ethical hacking is fast becoming a mainstream career choice" [[citep:caldwell_ethical_2011][p. 13]] and, somewhat ridiculously, that "White hats have come out of the back bedroom and are heading for the boardroom" [[citep:caldwell_ethical_2011][p. 11]].

[fn:highwaymen] In the 17th and 18th centuries in Britain, long before there was an organized police force, the roads were plagued with highwaymen, mounted robbers who accosted travelers and took their money and valuables. Despite real highwaymen being mostly a curse on travelers and everyday people, the highwayman as a figure became a cultural locus and the subject of countless plays, broadside ballads, and early novels. The Irish highwaymen Redmond O'Hanlon, for example, became an emblem of resistance to the Anglo-Irish gentry. Macheath, the highwayman protagonist of John Gay's /The Beggar's Opera/, represents a noble and humanistic resistance to a corrupt and decadent society. In ephemeral broadsides such as /The Female Highwayman/, the figure was a site of otherness, an individual defying norms and standing outside society.

The figure of the hacker, like the figure of the highwayman, says a great deal about our cultural circumstances. If the highwayman is, quintessentially, nobility in the face of venality, the hacker is unrestricted freedom in the face of rationalizing and racinating system. The figure of the hacker, I hope, can be useful to us in the same way the highwayman was useful centuries ago, even if literal, real-world highwaymen and hackers turn out to be disappointing in comparison to the ideal.

** Shared Concerns

Both hackers and people with disabilities are, fundamentally, concerned with the problem of access. Old-school hackers—the Stallmanss, Drapers, and Wozniaks of the world—care about access because they have a primal need to dig into the core of a machine, system, or program. Without the access granted through informal peer groups or initiatives such as the free and open source software movement, the kind of exploratory work with which these first hackers are associated becomes impossible. Hackers of the other stripe, those appearing in news stories about state actors and data breaches, are also concerned with (frequently unauthorized) access. By definition, these hackers are outsiders seeking entrance to systems from which they have been excluded.

To illustrate the basis of these shared concerns, we might compare the story of Eric Dibner's intervention—illicitly beveling street corners in Berkeley during the height of the Independent Living movement—to the origin story of one of the most famous hackers of the MIT scene. As with the beveling intervention, Richard Stallman, in 1980, contended with a question of accessibility that, like the raised street corner, served as a microcosm for an existential threat to a thriving culture. In the AI Lab of the 1970s and early 1980s, programmers had created an environment based on radical sharing and radical trust. Any individual could, and did, contribute to the lab's infrastructure, accessing at will any machine, code, or account. In 1980, however, a gift from outside the lab—a cutting-edge printer provided by engineers at the famous Xerox PARC in Palo Alto—threatened to disrupt this ethos. The printer, a modified Xerox copier, would jam frequently, leading to confusion and a lack of coordination as jobs piled up and no single individual knew that repairs were necessary. Stallman, in the past, had resolved similar issues by writing additional functionality for the printer and the network that sent messages about the status of the printer to those actively using it. However, in this case, when Stallman requested the source code for the printer from an individual working with PARC, he was refused. Stallman, surprised and mortified by this breach of the ethos of sharing that prevailed among hackers at the time, sensed that the incident foretold trouble for the culture of sharing, exploration, and autonomy he had come to value:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Now that the laser printer had insinuated itself within the AI Lab's network, however, something had changed. The machine worked fine, barring the occasional paper jam, but the ability to modify according to personal taste had disappeared. ... From Stallman's viewpoint, the printer was a Trojan Horse. After a decade of failure, privately owned software-future hackers would use the term "proprietary" software-had gained a foothold inside the AI Lab through the sneakiest of methods. It had come disguised as a gift. (Williams, 2002)
#+END_QUOTE
Stallman was correct. In the years following, startups and corporations seeking to monetize work done in and around MIT and the AI Lab snapped up hackers from the community, asking them to sign non-disclosure agreements that wore away the culture of openness at the lab and ultimately led to Stallman's exile. This experience, a traumatic one for Stallman, eventually resulted in his creation of the Free Software Foundation, an organization that has deeply influenced how software is developed, both politically and pragmatically. Stallman's philosophy that comprehensibility and freedom in the development of software are questions of morality and ethics, and not merely of business practices, has not always been accepted in the field—the more widely-known open source movement arose as a business-friendly, "neutral" alternative to the free software movement. Nonetheless, Stallman's FSF has been instrumental in developments that serve billions, including the creation of the Linux operating system and the innovation that is copyleft licensing[fn:copyleft].

[fn:copyleft] According to copyleft.org, "[c]opyleft is a strategy of utilizing copyright law to pursue the policy goal of fostering and encouraging the equal and inalienable right to copy, share, modify and improve creative works of authorship" citep:copyleft.org_copyleft.org_2014. The best-known vehicles for copyleft are the GNU General Public License (GPL) for code and the Creative Commons suite of licenses for non-code works. Copyleft licenses have been called viral because when a work with a GPL or CC license is incorporated into or used as the basis for another work, that work, too, must also bear the same or a compatible copyleft license. This encourages, and in some cases mandates, the growth of a commons of freely usable works. For copyleft works, the only restrictive right exercised under copyright law is the right to further restrict.


# !!! END FOOTNOTE !!!

Dibner and Stallman's stories are not equivalent—for one, Dibner's "hacking" of Berkeley street corners helped strengthen the community around the Center for Independent Living and the early disability rights movement, while Stallman, despite his efforts, failed to preserve intact the hacker community at the AI Lab. Yet both encountered infrastructure that threatened their communities and both took steps to change that infrastructure. Each sought to bring technology in the built environment, technology originating outside of their community's locus of control, into tractability, making it serve not only those with the power to create infrastructure in the first place but also their own community. In both cases, redesigned infrastructure—curb cuts and improved printer software—would better serve everyone, not just the community in question, a generally accepted outcome of attention to accessibility that is today called "universal access." Finally, these interventions, whether successful, limited in their success, or unsuccessful, served to galvanize the individual, and their community, around activism that brought about wider change.

Communities of hackers and communities of people with disabilities share other, arguably more superficial, similarities. Frequently, the concept of "user-friendliness" is viewed with suspicion by hackers and by people with disabilities, by hackers because the ideology frequently obscures the real nature of a system and by people with disabilities because user-friendly design too often makes assumptions based on "normal" or "average" users. Both communities share a tendency toward function over form—that is, appreciating what something can do over how it looks while doing it. These similar tendencies, far from universal, will be discussed further in Chapters 2 and 3. For now, however, the most important correspondence between these communities—hackers and people with disabilities—is a desire, grounded in both moral urgency and pragmatic self-interest, to make technology, especially infrastructure, serve the local as well as the remote, the low as well as the high, the distributed as well as the central, and those without power as well as those with power.

** What Is Haccessibility?

If infrastructure comprises material and social circumstances, such as roads, housing, communications systems, organizations, laws, and resources, that determine what is practical and possible, then haccessibility is the creation of personal infrastructure that expands the boundaries of the possible in ways that are personal, small-scale, and resistant to larger forces. The term can apply to anyone, whether teenagers (mis)using mentions of promoted brands on Facebook to receive a signal boost from its algorithm or the business executive who uses a desktop computer as a footstool. However, the term is highly significant for people with disabilities, since adaptations, workarounds, prosthetics, individualized skills, and acts of provocation and resistance are critical to their ability to survive and thrive in an able world. Beyond its tendency toward self-determination, another critical aspect of haccessibility is its indifference to propriety and the need or desire to "pass" in wider society. Like the old-school hackers from which the term is derived, those who practice haccessibility often violate boundaries in order to expand their capabilities, explore their environment, and play at the boundaries of the acceptable, the possible, and the expected.

To put it another way, haccessibility is about creating infrastructure—for oneself or for one's community—with resources that are local to the immediate environment. Practically speaking, this often means repurposing resources or infrastructure already present. In its ideal form, haccessibility means the creation of a certain kind of infrastructure, one that is responsive not only to its creator but also to its users. This is not user-friendliness, since user-friendliness as an ideology attempts to anticipate the needs of its users, and this anticipation cannot take into account the full gamut of preferences and capabilities of all groups and individuals. Rather, it is the acknowledgment that such anticipation is impossible and the encouragement, in design and intent, of further repurposing by users. In this sense, haccessibility is what programmers would call recursive, or self-referential and repeating. This is because a well-designed piece of haccessible infrastructure will lead to further repurposings, hacks and contributions, which may in turn lead to their own, and so on. 

Joshua Miele, a blind scientist and designer at the Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute, has articulated this recursive property in discussions of making a meta-maker movement. In these presentations, Miele describes meta-making as creating tools for creating tools. The projects Miele himself has initiated, such as Blind Arduino, perfectly embody this meta-making ethos. Arduino is a low-cost, open source electronics platform used for prototyping devices. As the project description observes, "while blind people could independently develop projects using Arduino, many of the important accessibility steps were undocumented and unknown" (Smith-Kettlewell, 2015). The project, which included a workshop series and continues as a blog, provides essential knowledge for working eyes-free with Arduino. As the project brings blind and low vision individuals in from the cold, they, in turn, are likely to contribute to a growing ecosystem of hackers and developers. Similar projects, such as the Raspberry VI—short for Visually Impaired—mailing list, centered on the popular Raspberry Pi series of single-board (read: small) computers, have enabled communities of knowledge creation to form around technologies that are flexible and inexpensive.


** Hacking High Costs

Haccessible infrastructure is, or should be, low-cost. Living with a disability is expensive. In developed countries, limb prosthetics, though they vary widely in cost, generally are priced in line with a car and must be replaced every few years—three years on average, but as low as a few months in some cases. Hearing aids, in 2018, cost between $1`,500 and $3,000 for a single ear, about the cost of two months' rent for the average American household (Freuler, 2015). Screen readers, an essential piece of software for the blind, can also cost a great deal. The JAWS screen reader, by some measures still the most popular, cost $895 in 2018, or $1095 for the professional version. A refreshable Braille display, necessary for using Braille in conjunction with a computer, can range in cost from around $3,500 to around $15,000. The high costs for these and countless other forms of infrastructure for people with disabilities mean that these technologies do not generally respect the autonomy of their users. Because they are based on proprietary—secret and legally protected—technology, they are generally not easy to repair and cannot be modified by the user. In addition, their high cost means that an external contributor—a family, a neighborhood, a school, or a government—must frequently step in to pay. While such costs are often gladly shared, such reliance can provoke feelings of guilt and can be a blow to independence for people with disabilities. Arguably the worst outcome of these high costs is their reinforcement of other forms of inequality, particularly class based, racial, and geographic inequality. For example, while many children in the Global North can take advantage of programs to subsidize prosthetic limbs—though non-veteran adults frequently cannot—limb prosthesis in the Global South is almost universally nonexistent or unaffordable. According to the World Health Organization, 80% of those with a physical disability live in countries classified as low-income, and of that 80%, fewer than 2% have access to rehabilitative services [[citep:dally_characteristics_2015][p. 66]].

A number of communities have begun to coalesce around the creation and modification of low-cost alternatives to proprietary technologies for people with disabilities. Many of these communities are small and, as will be discussed in Chapter 3, suffer from issues of algorithmic effacement—that is, interested individuals frequently cannot discover such communities through online means due to the inherent majoritarianism of search and social platforms. Online communities of people with specific concerns related to disability often resemble the early internet of the 90s or the modern dark web, operating primarily through vectors such as word of mouth, a loose federation of links, and serendipity.

Hearing Hacks (hearinghacks.com), a self-described "community of hearing aid users, hackers, #audpeeps, audiologists and hearingcare innovators who care about improving life with hearing loss," is one such group. The community was founded by an individual with moderately severe hearing loss who, in 2014, was inspired by the experience of helping a startup develop a smartphone-based hearing test and hearing amplifier, realizing that, in his own words, "change is possible even if it seems too hard. And that it’s easier with a group" (Trombetta, 2015). The group is organized around a blog and occasional small conferences and meetups. "Hacks," as envisioned by the group, are not necessarily technical, but can equally be social or even philosophical. The group includes both technical and non-technical contributors. A recap of one recent meetup involved a session brainstorming ideas for more effective communication with friends, family, and colleagues, including plans to draft a script to explain hearing loss to others and a filter for TripAdvisor to find quiet venues in an area. Groups such as Hearing Hacks represent both the fragility and resilience of small communities of people with disabilities online. Communities like Hearing Hacks have, in recent years, been instrumental in galvanizing support for low-cost and modifiable alternatives to expensive proprietary hearing aids, and ongoing work toward open source software, such as Leibnitz University's Cape4all, and commoditized hardware, based on inexpensive microcomputers such as the BeagleBoard, is encouraging.

In the blind community, one low-cost, modifiable, and community-oriented revolution has already taken place. For many years, blind computer users were faced with a dilemma: pay an extremely high, and often recurring, price for the JAWS screen reader, or not use a computer at all. Frequently, the cost of even the initial license for JAWS would be more than the cost of the computer itself. Though JAWS allowed many blind and low vision people to work with computers, this high cost shut many out and was a significant burden even on those able to afford it. In 2007, two blind programmers, Michael Curran and James Teh, set out to create a screen reader that would be open source and free of charge. This was a monumental undertaking—screen readers are an esoteric technology, and unlike operating systems, compilers, or other significant forms of software infrastructure, there are no books or university courses for learning how to create one. According to Curran, speaking of the creators of other, proprietary screen readers, “`[w]hatever they created couldn’t be leveraged because we couldn’t see their code, so we had to pretty much invent everything ourselves. .. That really depended on trial and error.'" (Preusler, 2017). The new screen reader, Non-Visual Desktop Access (NVDA), has proven successful, popular, and, perhaps most importantly, free of charge. In addition, NVDA users can write and share their own add-ons, allowing individuals to change the behavior of the screen reader to their own preferences or to adapt it to specialized tasks. NVDA add-ons have, for example, allowed blind hackers to use previously inaccessible editors for programming, play certain previously inaccessible games such as Pokemon Crystal, speak with one another through Internet Relay Chat (IRC), and work with quantitative data in the form of tables and equations.

# Such groups can appear and disappear quickly, and it already seems that Hearing Hacks most active period might remain 2015-2016. With that said, the importance of such communities to their participants and their niche nature mean that ecosystems of small communities of disabled practice online have survived in some form while larger communities that once thrived on the open web have been absorbed or destroyed by Facebook and Google.

# To this end, Thomas retells much of hacking’s history, from its little-known origins in phone “phreaking," through the hacker Eden of the 1960s. During this period (still fondly remembered by many participants) in the computer labs of MIT, Cornell and Harvard information and equipment were shared and it was accepted that any person had the right to tinker with anything that they could improve (such that, “[i]n a perfect hacker world...anyone pissed off enough to open up a control box near a traffic light and take it apart to make it work better should be perfectly welcome to..." (15)). Thomas notes the irony, however, that (Legg, 2005, p. 151)

# People with disabilities, especially those in certain affinity groups, often gravitate toward playful, clever, or community-minded resolutions to daily struggles, casting them in a role similar to the "original" hacker. At the same time, the need to surmount obstacles presented by lack of accessibility just as often casts people with disabilities in the role of the hacker as outsider, criminal, and suspect.

** Hacking To Live

As we have, if briefly, observed, disability is expensive, and access is often a premium good reserved for those in the developed world with ample resources. In this context, infrastructure following a hacker ethos can be life-changing, allowing people with disabilities to make a living and live their lives to their full potential. In some cases, however, the need for specific hacks to live life is fully literal—that is, some people with disabilities are dependent on specific hacks for their health and even their continued existence.

The Mayo Clinic defines sleep apnia as "a potentially serious sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts" citep:mayo_clinic_sleep_2019. The condition increases risk of metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and heart disease, and can increase the chance of complications related to surgery. One of the main forms of treatment for sleep apnea is through use of a CPAP, or Continuous Positive Airway Pressure, machine, which keeps nasal passages open and prevents the cessation of breathing during sleep. CPAP machines are considered medical devices, and though they collect data for diagnostic and research purposes, that data is not made available to users in any form. Instead, patients are supposed to bring an SD card to their medical appointment, have a doctor read the data, and make changes to the settings and usage of the device based on their recommendations. Though this requirement sounds initially reasonable, just as a person with diabetes benefits from feedback on blood sugar levels to identify problems and patterns in real time, those with sleep apnea benefit from access to their own data to resolve highly local problems. This post on MyApnea.Org, a web forum for those with sleep apnea, shows the usefulness of user access to sleep data:

After one of those nights from h-ll, waking up initially on the machine after 1.5 hours and not being able to get back to sleep right away, I looked at Sleepyhead software with the expectation I wouldn't find anything significant. I was totally wrong as it looks like a large leak woke me up. I then realized that the eye-ware mask I woke last night to block out light on a new humidifier that I bought to use in addition to the machine, probably dislodged the mask. Anyway, I turned the humidifier around this morning to block out the light and hopefully, that will solve the problem. citep:unassumingorangeredcormorant9252_sleepyhead_2015

In the case of the CPAP user above, it is much less likely that, after waiting days or weeks to see a doctor, and being removed from the immediate circumstances of the machine's failure, they would have had a similar insight. At the same time, as they waited for a meeting with a doctor, their machine would not have been functioning properly, jeopardizing their sleep and their health. Further, many doctors do not have the training, time, or inclination to analyze and interpret the data generated by a CPAP, while the patient, often in cooperation with an online community, is highly motivated to uncover patterns and can more easily correlate them with their own subjective experience of impaired sleep. 

# Unfortunately for those wishing to read their own CPAP data, the logs created by these machines come encumbered by Digital Rights Management (DRM) restrictions that prevent users from reading their contents. 

The software used in the above example, Sleepyhead, is a powerful example of haccessibility:[fn:sleepyhead]

The free, open-source, and definitely not FDA-approved piece of software is the product of thousands of hours of hacking and development by a lone Australian developer named Mark Watkins, who has helped thousands of sleep apnea patients take back control of their treatment from overburdened and underinvested doctors. The software gives patients access to the sleep data that is already being generated by their CPAP machines but generally remains inaccessible, hidden by proprietary data formats that can only be read by authorized users (doctors) on proprietary pieces of software that patients often can’t buy or download. citep:koebler_why_2018.
#+END_QUOTE
One patient whose CPAP was not resolving her apnea and who had a doctor who was largely uninterested in examining her data observed that her CPAP experience using the software was "night and day" and that she is "possibly alive because it exists" citep:koebler_why_2018.

[fn:sleepyhead] In 2019, Watkins discontinued his involvement with the Sleepyhead project somewhat acrimoniously after disagreements with members of the community over development priorities citep:watkins_sleepyhead_2019. The project's code base has been forked (the free and open source term for split off and continued under different management) and development continues under the name OSCAR.

Though sleep apnea is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition, the CPAP machines that treat it , and the data they generate, are still located outside of our bodies. In other cases, the boundaries among the medical device, the data it generates, and the self are more indeterminate, making control of medical data by private corporations even more troubling. Hugo Campos, a programmer, designer, and, more recently, an advocate for patient rights, has for years sought access to a device, a cardiac defibrillator, that is implanted in his chest and which is hooked up to the internet. The device regulates the electric system that controls the beating of his heart, detecting any abnormalities and administering a corrective shock if necessary.[fn:proprietary-human-rights] Implanted in 2007, the model Campos received was one of the first to stream data over the internet, first to the manufacturer, Medtronic, and then to his doctors. Despite the fact that this data is data about his body, and generated by a device within his body, Campos was refused access to the information it generated. In a profile for /The Economist/, Campos recalls his initial reaction: "'I remember thinking that I'd be able to get alerts from the device, to see what it was doing. I asked my doctor to point me to the patient website. And he looked at me and said, "Oh, this is all for us, not for you"'" ("THe Data Liberator, citeyear:the_economist_data_2019). Though Campos was frustrated by the proprietary nature of the data created within, and about, his own body, the situation became more dire when, in 2012, he lost access to his health insurance. In practice, that meant losing all insight into the operation of the defibrillator implanted in his chest, the data for which includes essential dimensions such as battery life of the device, fluid buildup in the chest, and the amount of time it takes to administer a life-saving shock ("Fighting for the Right to Open his Heart Data", citeyear:hugo_campos_fighting_2011). In response, Campos purchased a pacemaker program on Ebay and flew to South Carolina for a course on how to read his data—a course at which he was the only non-doctor in attendance ("Hugo Campos", citeyear:stanford_university_hugo_2016). Campos's largest victory to date came in 2015, when the Librarian of Congress granted a three-year special dispensation for Campos and three other patient researchers to circumvent technical measures put in place by medical device manufacturers to block patient access to data citep:sellars_dmca_2015. Though this ruling represented a hard-won legal victory for patients' rights, it was still only a first step and, years later, there are still not widespread protections in place to allow patients access to data created by their own bodies and for their own treatment. Dave deBronkart, another patient rights advocate, noted at the time of the ruling that "this is a far cry from what e-patient advocates really want (medical device interoperability, standardized data formats, and better data access through open APIs) to help pave the way toward transparency, which is critical for patients to know what's happening in their bodies" citep:debronkart_key_2015. 

[fn:proprietary-human-rights] In researching Hugo Campos and the e-patient movement, I encountered a group, "Hu-manity.co, advocating for the creation by the UN of a 31st human right, the "right to legal ownership of ... [one's] inherent human data as property," to be "added to the existing 30 human rights adopted by the United Nations in 1948" citep:hu-manity.co_hu-manity.co:_2020. The group appears to be creating an app, "ClubPrivate," that would serve as in intermediary so that consumers could sell their own personal medical data to companies, a fee, naturally, going to Hu-manity.co. I'm not sure how late capitalism a society has to be to have hybrid for-profit / non-profit legal entities pushing through new internationally-sanctioned human rights to create first mover advantage in a new market, but we're there.

Since the late 2000s, there has been increased advocacy and awareness for patients' rights and, specifically, the right to access devices and data protected by industry DRM.[fn:digital-rights-management] As medical information available online is increasingly consumed by patients as well as doctors, an e-patient movement has formed around this new form of participatory medicine. "E-patient," originally coined to refer to "electronic patients" or patients that perform their own research on the web, has become a self-designation for those who are, according to a white paper released by the Society for Participatory Medicine, "empowered, equipped, engaged, [and] enabled in their health and healthcare decisions" citep:ferguson_e-patients:_2007. In 2009, a self-designated e-patient, Dave deBronkart, was invited to give a keynote at a medical conference from a patient perspective and, out of frustration, titled his talk "Gimme My Damn Data, Because You Guys Can't Be Trusted" citep:debronkart_gimme_2019. The talk, and the provokative title, became a rallying cry and sub-movement of the larger patients' rights, e-patient, and participatory medicine movements. These developments are paralleled in recent, and at least mildly successful, advocacy initiatives such as the Right to Repair movement. There is a sad irony in the fact that farmers seeking access to the repair specifications and data products of their tractors share almost identical concerns to patients seeking insight into the operations of their pacemakers, glucose monitors, bladder stimulators, and hearing aids. However, due to the enclosure of fundamental rights through the application of technological and legal measures such as DRM and the DMCA, the e-patient and Right to Repair movements are natural allies, and progress in advocacy, infrastructure development, and the law might prove broadly beneficial.[fn:software-concentration]

[fn:digital-rights-management] Digital Rights Management, or DRM, is software or software features intended to restrict a user's use of the software or an associated device. Essentially, DRM is a digital lock, or an attempt to put something like a lock in place in an environment, the general-purpose computer, in which such restrictions are inherently technically difficult. Cory Doctorow observes that "DRMs are technologies that treat the owner of a computer or other device as an attacker, someone against whom the system must be armored. Like the electrical meter on the side of your house, a DRM is a technology that you possess, but that you are never supposed to be able to manipulate or modify" citep:doctorow_content:_2008. DRM is often more of a legal barrier than a technical one—putting in place technical restrictions gives corporations the ability to pursue violations in court under laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.


[fn:software-concentration] Past decades have seen dramatic market concentration in the United States citep:grullon_are_2019,gutierrez_declining_2017,de_loecker_rise_2017 , including the emergence of a winner take all (or most) dynamic in the medical and technology industries [[citep:van_reenen_increasing_2018][p. 3]]. As anti-trust laws go unexercised and sectors coalesce into oligopolies, corporations begin to wield disproportionate market and policy power over consumers (or, as we were once innocently known, the public), and regulatory capture and undue industry influence in government become endemic. Concentration, however, comes with certain liabilities, and there is some reason to believe that widespread disgust with the excesses in these industries could mean that the pendulum swings the other way. A strong and history-aware introduction to the remergence of oligopoly and market power is /The Curse of Bigness/ citep:wu_curse_2018, especially Chapter 7, "The Rise of the Tech Trusts."

A final, sobering example shows the need for the local, informal expertise, embedded in communities, that I associate here with haccessibility. Polio is a virus that, in some infected individuals, can result in paralysis of the legs and, in severe cases, the head, neck, or diaphragm. After the development, approval, and introduction of the polio vaccine in the mid-1950s, occurrences of polio were dramatically reduced worldwide. However, even in the United States there are individuals who continue to be affected by exposure to the polio virus, and who require major interventions, including the use of a tank respirator, better known as an iron lung, to live. The last iron lungs were manufactured over 50 years ago, and there are no extant manufacturers of either the devices or the parts needed to maintain them.

A commonality in the stories of those who continue to need an iron lung to survive is hyperlocal—community or family—technical expertise. In a 2017 profile on the last remaining users of the iron lung, we see this necessary dependence on informal—sideways rather than top down—community know-how, but also the terrible consequences that follow when it is absent:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Recently, an ice storm knocked [polio survivor Martha Lillard's] ... power out for three days and the generator malfunctioned. The fire department came over but they wouldn’t run a power line from down the street or provide a temporary generator, Lillard said. Fortunately, one of the firefighters came by when he was off-duty and fixed the generator. During the panic, Lillard thought about Dianne Odell, a polio survivor who died in her iron lung in Memphis in 2008, after she lost power during a storm. Her father and brother-in-law took turns pumping the bellows by hand but couldn’t sustain the rhythm long enough to keep her alive. citep:brown_last_2017
#+END_QUOTE
As we see here, the upkeep of an iron lung is not a matter of top-down infrastructure or political organization. There are too few polio survivors who require an iron lung to live to make the manufacture, sale, or maintenance of these devices economically feasible, and too few survivors to formulate or advocate for political measures to remedy the situation from above.[fn:top-down] The above recounting of Lillard's experience should be chilling, and not only on one level. Superficially, her story is moving as a close call, relatable in the same way that any life-threatening emergency is relatable.. On a deeper level, her experience reveals a fundamental disconnect, an inability of the /polis/, of society at scale, to intervene on the meso or human level, to adapt to a set of conditions where a fundamental need is not as assumed.

The level at which this experience should disturb, however, is this: /those who needed an iron lung, and who did not have access to specific skills through their immediate community, were already dead./ Over fifty years, the breakdown of such a machine as an iron lung is not a matter of if, but when. In reality, these devices require constant maintenance, with a major intervention or overhaul every few decades—Lillard's cuff, for example, needed to be replaced more than ten times. The fact that each of these survivors has access to an individual capable of such interventions is not a coincidence, but rather a precondition.

It may seem that these iron lung survivors, as an example of the absolute need for haccessibility in some situations, constitutes an extreme example. I would argue, however, that their stories are extraordinary only in that the exigent nature of their need is comprehensible to outsiders. We are all dependent on informal community relationships and structures for survival. In the cases of many people with disabilities, the need for informal, meso-level knowledge and infrastructure is absolutely essential. However, structure and community that meet these needs are, by definition, resolving issues that resist comprehension from outside, commonality across larger groups, and top-down intervention. Locality, fundamentally, is not broadly legible. To the extent that fundamentally local needs, fundamentally local concerns, can be understood at the level of society, they cease to be local. The extent that the society can accommodate locality is not the extent to which it can hand down tailor-made solutions to individual situation and circumstances. Rather, it is in relinquishing control to the local, to the meso-level, in granting /autonomy/, a concept that will be a major concern of the following chapter.

[fn:top-down] We will explore this dynamic more thoroughly in the next chapter.

# ** Hacking As Advocacy

# If accessibility bridges the space between an individual and a normative goal, hacking bridges the space between an individual and a non-normative goal. That is, questions of accessibility typically apply when thinking about sanctioned actions, modes of engagement that are allowed by society. If the creators of a website wish it to be widely available to the public, then it is a failure of accessibility if that website cannot be accessed by an particular individual. If an individual wishes to read a digital book they have purchased from Amazon on a non-sanctioned device, however, that is not typically considered a question of accessibility. Instead, the space between the desire to read the book, perhaps even to share or archive it, and the reality of doing so becomes a question of hacking.


** Stepping Back From the Hacker

Occasionally, the straightest path between two points is a straight line. This chapter opened with Terry Garrett and his goal to play a particular game to completion. In realizing this goal, Garrett, unfortunately, did not bring sweeping changes to the video game industry. Even less surprisingly, Garrett did not uncover a universal cure for blindness. Yet it would be unfair to say that, in completing /Ocarina of Time/, Garrett accomplished nothing in the wider world. Brush was cleared from a path. A lamp was lit. A thought became easier to think. A small impossibility became, briefly, a small possibility.

In this chapter, I've drawn a series of parallels between people with disabilities and hackers. There is a sense in which I mean this as a notable, highly literal, and perhaps underrealized comparison. Hacking, as a practice, is broadly useful to many people with disabilities. Many people with disabilities, myself included, consider ourselves hackers. Many who are unaware of, or uncomfortable with, the term would be a credit to hackers everywhere should they choose to embrace it. People with disabilities and hackers, as we have seen, challenge the status quo, defy norms, distain barriers, create strong affinity groups, and build our own stuff.[fn:no-one][fn:cool][fn:annoying-emails]

[fn:no-one] Because no one else will.

Though I think this comparison is productive in itself, I also use it here as a starting point for a larger set of questions and concerns. These, fundamentally, revolve around autonomy—that is, the nature of the relationship between a subject and its environment, or the inside and the outside. In this chapter, we've focused on hacking as a mode of negotiation between the individual and the physical and social environment. In the next, we'll theorize autonomy in the context of disabled identity. Among other things, we'll consider autobiographies of disability, seeing how—and whether—they resist the majoritarian worldview enforced by society.

As we move forward in this project, we'll move outward. Haccessibility, fundamentally, is a mode that aids an individual, or an affinity group, to negotiate the immediate physical and social environment. Sometimes, it inspires or enables the creation of infrastructure, such as hackable hearing aids or the Non-Visual Desktop Access screen reader. It can also precipitate broader advocacy-based change. In focusing on autonomy and autobiography in the next chapter, we'll consider the ways individuals with disabilities express their own identities, but we'll also explore the relationship between a shared, constructed disability identity and the broader society. In Chapter 3, we'll examine larger built structures, specifically infrastructure, and while we'll still be concerned with the individual we will begin to consider threatened subject positions of larger entities and collectives such as the humanities or the academy. By the final chapter, we'll consider humanity's autonomy in a totalizing environment—one which, knowingly or unknowingly, we have constructed around ourselves.

Though we step away from the hacker as representative of a mode of negotiation, we'll ultimately revisit haccessibility and the ethos of the hacker as we search for solutions to larger questions of autonomy. Though hacking itself is limited as a mode of resistance and a vector for change, the hacking ethos, which holds up decentralization, locality, repurposing, and sharing, may provide us with ways forward as we contend with systems that promote injustice, inequality, waste, disenfranchisement, and exploitation. Though hacking frequently only grants autonomy to the hacker, and hacking itself requires forms of privilege that are not widely available, in building social and physical structures that are alterable and responsive to local needs it may be possible to democratize the kind of autonomy that is currently only available to the few.

* Autonomy and Autobiography
** Encountering Stuff

In the previous chapter, I used the word "autonomy" to describe certain arrangements among people and things, or among people and people. The term, at least in the context of a community of hackers or a Center for Independent Living, has positive connotations, evoking associated concepts such as freedom, dignity, and self-actualization. But what does it mean to be autonomous—or, for that matter, independent— in this sense? Upon cursory reflection, it seems obvious that we are all enmeshed in a complex web of relationships, that our lives are contingent on forces and processes beyond our direct control, and that we are all dependent on others to some greater or lesser extent. In an absolute sense, then, no individual is truly autonomous. Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing drives this home in a passage evocative of Daniel Kish's sentiments on his long white cane:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In order to survive, we need help, and help is always the service of another, with or without intent. When I sprain my ankle, a stout stick may help me walk, and I enlist its assistance. I am now an encounter in motion, a woman-and-stick. It is hard for me to think of any challenge I might face without soliciting the assistance of others, human and not human. It is unselfconscious privilege that allows us to fantasize—counterfactually—that we each survive alone. citep:tsing_mushroom_2015
#+END_QUOTE
It seems clear that no individual can be entirely independent. Yet terms such as autonomy, used to describe the nature, kind, and quality of subjective actions and connections, have weight. This chapter, concerned primarily with subjective experiences of disability as explored through autobiography, is concerned with accounts of day-to-day experiences in the lives of people with disabilities, and in particular the interactions between the individual and the immediate physical and social environment. But on what basis do we evaluate these relationships? Are independence and autonomy chimeras, products only of a refusal to acknowledge one's presence in an interconnected web of people and things? If the concept of autonomy is actually useful, should it be applied as a subjective evaluation, or can we fit it into a broader theory of a world full of people and things, narratives and perspectives?

Martin Heidegger, in /Being and Time/, provides a framework for conceiving of the relationship between the subjective self and the immediate physical environment. In a well-known example, that of the hammer, Heidegger contends that entities in the world have a property, handiness, that is revealed through their use:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Hammering does not just have a knowledge of the useful character of the hammer; rather, it has appropriated this utensil in the most adequate way possible. ... [T]he less we just stare at the thing called hammer, the more we take hold of it and use it, the more original our relation to it becomes and the more undisguisedly it is encountered as what it is, as a useful thing. The act of hammering itself discovers the specific "handiness" ["Handlichkeit"] of the hammer. We shall call the useful thing's kind of being in which it reveals itself by itself handiness [Zuhandenheit].
#+END_QUOTE
In this Heidegarian paradigm, the world is given shape through the use of entities that are to hand. When we tell time using a clock, the nature of the clock is revealed. Heidegger does not mean that we learn objective truths about the clock—rather, our experience of the clock becomes that of an entity useful for telling time. 

Though Heidegger describes the use of a hammer or the reading of a clock as discovering, as our own subjective self, a property of handiness, we might, more or less equivalently, construe the change as a forging of a relationship between our self and the thing at hand. When we use the hammer, we draw it towards us. It becomes part of our sphere of influence, a thing over which we have, and through which we exercise, autonomy. However, thinking of the subjective universe in terms of Heidegger's handiness ignores a critical vector. Heidegger's /das Zeug/, typically translated as "equipment" but which, more critically but still accurately, might be called "stuff," suggests a passive or receptive world waiting to be seized. However, as anyone who has caught themselves on barbed wire can attest, stuff is neither passive nor neutral. Whoever uses stuff should see to it that in the process they are not used by stuff. And as you reach out through stuff, stuff will reach out through you. To put it another way, the built environment around us isn't just composed of neutral artifacts waiting for us to discover their useful properties. Instead, they are frequently the equipment of another, serving another's purposes. In the modern environment, when we reach out for an artifact such as a vending machine, a card reader, a park bench, or a cell phone, we do not simply find useful equipment, but become useful equipment. While these objects are "to hand" and, ostensibly, serve our immediate purposes, their use coopts us into broader systems over which we have little control. In raising these tools, we, in turn, become equipment in distant hands.

Does this get us closer to an understanding of autonomy, or suggest whether the concept is useful for understanding how we, as people, negotiate our environment? In this chapter, I propose to consider autonomy as the /condition of not being acted through/. To be autonomous, by this view, is to not be the tool of another. If we are drawn closer to someone or something, if we become "to hand" in the Heidegarian sense, then in that regard we are not acting with autonomy. This more specific definition of autonomy will be useful because this chapter, and this project as a whole, is concerned with negotiation—points or surfaces where the individual encounters the world. Autonomy, or a lack of it, provides one way to describe not only the shape and substance of these interfaces, but also a directionality: outward or inward, acting or acted upon. In this sense, we are concerned with autonomy because it allows us to understand the nature and direction of our relationships and connections, the wheft of our encounter with the world, or, as Anna Tsing would describe it, the precarity of our place in a greater assemblage.

** Ghosts and Levers

How, in encountering the world, finding that which is handy or to hand, and using stuff for our own ends, might we, in turn, become equipment? How do we, in acting, become a medium through which another can act?

The phenomenological perspective articulated by Heidegger in /Being and Time/ regards space in a sense that is holistic, rather than literal. Objects and entities to which we are habituated, or through which we act, are near to us. Entities that are unfamiliar to us, or through which we cannot act, can only be near to us in the trivial sense of being literally proximate to us.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Thus, we cannot understand by this the objective presence of a corporeal thing [Korperding] (the human body [Menschenleib]) "in" a being objectively present. Nor does the term being-in designate a spatial "in one another" of two things objectively present, any more than the word "in" primordially means a spatial relation of this kind.' "In" stems from innan-, to live, habitare, to dwell. "An" means I am used to, familiar with, I take care of something. It has the meaning of colo in the sense of habito and diligo.
#+END_QUOTE
Literal, physical space is not unimportant to Heidegger, since physical space does matter to whether an object is "to hand" and thus part of the world as we encounter it—it's difficult to drive a nail with a hammer located in another country. But the nature of the relationship to the entity is at least as important. If books are a feature of our ongoing encounter with the world—what Heidegger calls /Dasein/—then learning to read will bring us closer to them. Since space, in this conception, depends on the nature of our encounter with the world, we can think of a wheelbarrow as making objects lighter, a bicycle as making a city smaller, and socks as making a room warmer. Though Heidegger's examples, such as his hammer, are mostly in this vein, he does begin to apprehend more dramatic alterations to the nearness and distance of things in their relationship to us imposed by technology:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Initially and for the most part, de-distancing is a circumspect approaching, a bringing near as supplying, preparing, having at hand. But particular kinds of the purely cognitive discovery of beings also have the character of bringing near. An essential tendency toward nearness lies in Dasein.* All kinds of increasing speed which we are more or less compelled to go along with today push for overcoming distance. With the "radio," for example, Dasein is bringing about today a de-distancing of the "world," which is unforeseeable in its meaning for Dasein, by way of expanding and destroying the everyday surrounding world.
#+END_QUOTE
The Heideggerian worldview, where space is a function of our own nature and the nature of our relationship to the objects and people around us, has implications for how we think about autonomy, not as a separation or independence from the world around us but as a measure of our ability to meaningfully act, to draw things closer to us or to distance ourselves from them.

There are other implications to this worldview. One is that stuff has allegiance. While we make demands on the built environment—sitting in chairs, opening doors, looking out windows, climbing up stairs—the built environment makes demands on us. The locked door or gate bars passage, creating demarcations where there is distance for one and nearness for another. Adversarial equipment (fences, walls, doors, signs, checkpoints, in a social context, functionally determines geography, how space for us is constituted.[fn:hostile_architecture]

[fn:hostile_architecture] I use the term adversarial equipment here to contrast with Heidegger's concept of equipment as handy or to hand, and as a more general term that can apply equally to objects, devices, and architecture. In architecture more specifically, this concept has been called hostile architecture, defensive architecture, exclusionary design, or unpleasant design. Examples include spiked park benches to discourage overnight sleeping, irritating sounds to deter youth congregation, or blue lights to make it difficult for drug users to find veins. See /Callous Objects: Designs Against the Homeless/ citep:rosenberger_callous_2017 and /Unpleasant Design/ citep:savicic_unpleasant_2016.

Thinking of the phenomenon more broadly, however, we see a key threat to the exercise of our autonomy. The more we look around our built environment, the more we see that it is filled with entities that reach out to and through us, but do not allow reaching back in return. That is, these objects, though close to us in a literal sense, are distant from us in the real way that we encounter the world. Though we will engage with this idea more fully in the next chapter when we consider the implications of infrastructure for negotiation, we can see this reality most plainly and obtrusively in the object, and ideology, of the smartphone. 

These interfaces constrain behavior, encouraging specific sanctioned uses, and especially passive consumption, while reporting detailed information on user behavior and location. Though the smartphone is an intimate companion—a majority of Americans keep them in reach as they sleep—they are, in a Heideggerian sense, alarmingly distant from the users they appear to serve. Despite their intimate physical proximity, the smartphone as an artifact is itself never drawn closer to us and is never "to hand" in the sense of the hammer—ironic, given the German word for cell phone is the faux-loanword /Handy/. The smartphone does not conform itself to us, but conforms our interactions and behavior to its abstract affordances. Some artifacts—a cane, a pot, and, yes, a hammer—create energy, connections, impetus that flow from us and our volition outward to our immediate environment. Other artifacts—the codex and the letter come to mind—allow for others in far places and times to reach out to us, and the impetus flows in great part from the world and toward ourselves. These artifacts, however, allow us to encounter them largely on our own terms—my trade paperback of /Twilight/ won't report my reading habits back to Stephenie Meyer, but my Kindle edition of Snowden's /Permanent Record/ will happily, and with great irony, report on me to Amazon. The smartphone, and its eReader and tablet cousins , are not artifacts in the sense of the hammer—without constant two-way communication they are fit only for the landfill. Rather, they should be thought of as interfaces, processes, or, most evocatively, presences.[fn:creepy]

[fn:creepy] The ubiquity of the term "creepy" to describe the feeling of presence evoked by a literally proximate but subjectively distant piece of equipment alludes to the ambiguous relationship we have with these interfaces. Our cell phone is creepy for the same reason a ghost is creepy: it is both present and not present, and its nature, goals, and relationship to us can only be engaged with, at least for most of us mortals, on the level of intuition.

The corporate and government organizations that gather data and influence behavior through our smartphones exert influence that is a palpable but indistinct influence, invisible but nonetheless determinant of our subjective experiences. These ghosts are felt only in the exercise of their agendas, whether through dark patterns[fn:1] crafted to extract money or data or through the discouragement of actions or technologies that might disrupt the status quo. Therefore, when we pick up a smartphone, we are using the device, but not appropriating it, making it "to hand" in the sense of the hammer or the pot. Instead, we become ourselves "to hand," becoming a vehicle, a point of leverage, for distant and dimly apprehended presences.

[fn:1] In programming, a design pattern is a broad approach to solving a common problem or category of problems. In 2010, Harry Brignull, a user experience designer, created darkpatterns.org to draw attention to a trend in user experience design that pushes users toward choices counter to their own interests, such as sending invites to a service to email contacts or signing up for recurring payments. "Dark pattern" is now an accepted term for design decisions that leverage an understanding of behavior in the aggregate for ends that are coercive or user-hostile.

We attribute a bold claim to Archimedes: "Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world." Imagine, for a moment, a world of warring Archimedes, straining, with their levers, to wrest the world in their preferred direction. To us, the fulcra, these engineers are hidden from our view, the reach of their levers too long for us to follow. We can only feel the torque, and note the movement of the world as a distant contender finds purchase. When we raise a phone, scroll through a feed, and touch the screen, we know that we communicate with distant others. But there is another presence or presences with us, determining what we see and do not see. These presences set the ground, creating the environment in which we exercise volition and benefiting from our actions. The shift of the lever might create or suppress a movement, determine the outcome of a close election, destroy a business, start a trend, or alter public opinion.[fn:nudges]

Another presence can be felt through the preferences of the normative majority in the lived environment. Conveniently, Heidegger presents another term for this normative entity: /das Man/, derived from the German equivalent of "one," as in "one must not do that." /Das Man/ shapes the nature of our built environment, determining who is included an who is excluded. /Das Man/ has working legs, and so the built environment gives precedence to stairs. /Das Man/ can drive, and so the dominant mode of transportation is the car. /Das Man/ is not pregnant, carries government-issued identification, and does not experience chronic pain. The environment around us is built for /Das Man/, and the presence of this normative entity, this demographic chimera, is felt in every assumption about our capabilities as we move through the world. To draw once again on our spatial metaphor, /Das Man/ exists in a world of short distances, open portals, and unimposed restrictions.

In an incisive application of Heidegger's conception of space to a disability studies context, Josephine A. Seguna outlines the differing relationship with space experienced by Nancy Mairs, a writer who moves through the world with the use of a wheelchair:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Heidegger (1962) maintains everything an individual deals with or engages, is either near or far relative to that individual and therefore the understanding of such 'nearness' and /or 'farness' becomes how an individual familiarizes or learns to represent oneself as space. This 'proximity' is the basis of how humankind comes to represent itself, not through containment or objective measurement but as a state of Being. Yet ... Mairs (1996), eloquent in asserting her personal perspective of the world, demonstrates the capacity of Heidegger's theory to question the alienation of the presupposed "subjective" province of the abled-bodied experience ... citep:seguna_space_2015
#+END_QUOTE
Seguna argues that Heidegger's phenomenological worldview—that a bicycle makes a city smaller, that a sweater makes a room warmer—is a useful model for disability studies in that it moves exclusionary practices from the subjective ("I feel excluded") to an understanding of the real nature of the world ("She is not allowed to be present"). If we take this proposition seriously, and perhaps we should, we might understand personal accounts and autobiography differently—that is, not as a peek into an isolated subjectivity, but as a description of the world, a universality reflected through locality. Consider briefly a passage from Mairs cited by Seguna: 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
... not one of them seemed to think that any life was going on below the level of her or his own gaze. “Down here!" I kept whimpering at the hips and buttocks and bellies pressing my wheelchair on all sides. “Down here! There’s a person down here!" My only recourse was to roll to one side and hug a wall. [[citep:mairs_waist-high_1996][p. 59]]
#+END_QUOTE
A naive commentator, reading this moving passage, might appreciate some insight into the disabled experience and perspective. I would argue, however, that this view is limited and self-protective, an act of seperation. We are all tyrannized by /das Man/, the normative and the majoritarian, yet some of us feel the disconnect between the local and the universal every day, every hour, or even every minute. For Mairs, this physical and social separation is not just a perspective, but the world as it exists.

So far, our discussion of autonomy has been largely abstract. Mairs's plea immediately and powerfully reifies the concept and its stakes. Autonomy is our ability to meaningfully act, to be fully present in the world, to be fully empersoned, to be not only an end but also a middle and a beginning. This brief passage is local to Mairs and her experience, but we easily abstract it to our own experience, drawing a connection to our understanding of the broader world and back to ourselves. In the remainder of this chapter, we will engage with other local experiences and understandings as expressed through personal accounts and, in particular, the autobiography as a form. Our concern is with the world as encountered, how built structures and presences as /das Man/ constrain autonomy, and how individuals negotiate through practices such as autobiographical recursion—that is, writing that reflects and affects life, and life that affects and reflects writing.

** The Thin Thread

# Let's talk about connections.

In the previous chapter, we situated negotiated access at meso level or person scale—that is, somewhere between a decontextualized self and a distant, universalized, or wide-angle view of society. Autobiography, as a form, traditionally draws a line between these points: the particular and the universal, the self and the society, the body and the body politic. In /Reading Autobiography/, Sidonie Smith and Julia Watson place the emergence of autobiography in the eighteenth century and with a preoccupation with the universal and metaphysical as manifest in the self:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Autobiography, now the most commonly used term for life writing, thus describes writing being produced at a particular historical juncture, the period prior to the Enlightenment in the West. Central to that movement was the concept of the self-interested individual of property who was intent on assessing the status of the soul or the meaning of public achievement. By the eighteenth century, notions of self-interest, self-consciousness, and self-knowledge informed the figure of the “Enlightened individual" described by philosophers and social and political theorists. citep:smith_reading_2002

#+END_QUOTE
For Smith and Watson, autobiography "privileges the autonomous individual and the universalizing life story as the definitive achievement of life writing" citep:smith_reading_2002. This formal preoccupation of autobiography with seeking out the universal within a life makes it a fraught site for depiction of lives experienced outside a universal norm. In /Negotiated Memory/, Julie Rak wrestles with this question, observing how non-Western epistemologies that emphasize connections among individuals and a communal spirituality cannot readily be mapped onto the Western autobiographical tradition: "It is hard for people raised in liberal traditions that assume that all people are unique and should exist as individuals, or who believe implicitly that spiritual matters are separate from material ones, to imagine this other set of ideas about what the production of knowledge and personhood itself can mean" [[citep:rak_negotiated_2005][p. 1]]. The generic form of the autobiography exerts a gravitational pull away from consideration of the local environment or community and toward the relationship of the self, and especially personality and morality, to the universal.

Post-colonial, feminist, and Marxist critics have rightfully regarded the autobiography with suspicion given the history and limitations of the genre, including the privileging of voices and perspectives that can be easily universalized and the distortion of those that cannot. Despite the unsuitability of the form to convey the stories of the minoritarian, the disenfranchised, or the simply different, those with perspectives resistant to imposition of a universal narrative still attempt to communicate their experiences through the form. Rak, with empathy and pragmatism, touches on why this might be the case:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Whether autobiography critics want to admit it or not, the “traditional" discourse of autobiography still carries much cultural capital in the West. People who have historically been unable to secure representation inside of the Welds that guarantee authenticity and legitimacy in Western discourse are often very much aware of the power of autobiographical dis- course when they choose to enter it. This makes it important to under- stand why people who do not enjoy the automatic assumptions of the representability of their lives in texts use the forms that may seem to exclude them. [[citep:rak_negotiated_2005][p. 2]]
#+END_QUOTE
In short, autobiography, reliant as a form on representability, the thin thread between the personal and the universal, does not easily serve stories and experiences that do not conform to a more general narrative. Despite this, the promise of the autobiography for self-expression and advocacy is such that those with truly divergent experiences cannot resist taking up the genre and conforming to, or attempting to transcend, its limitations.

In the previous chapter, we shifted our attention away from the isolated self, associated with the medical model of disability, and the broad collective, associated with the social model. Instead we focused on the local physical and social environment, the points at which an individual negotiates the world around them. This chapter on disability autobiography will share a similar concern with the local, and will consider disability autobiography from three perspectives. First, taking the texts of autobiographies at face value, we will draw on these works for examples of negotiation—local knowledge, community, and infrastructure that led to survival, autonomy, or self-actualization. Second, we will consider these autobiographies not from the inside, but from the outside, regarding the texts themselves as instances of negotiation. Considering the autobiographies themselves as pieces of infrastructure or as products of a community, or as failed or successful attempts to transcend an imposed narrative, sheds light on ongoing struggles for autonomy among people with disabilities. Finally, we will draw on the tensions between individual and society within autobiography to explore how people with disabilities negotiate between the local and the universal. As we will see, people with disabilities frequently struggle against narratives imposed on them by society. In biographies of disability, we see the struggle for purchase on the universal, the strategies employed by people with disabilities to contend with a casually hostile social consensus—the ignorant, apathetic, and sometimes cruel /das Man/. Like Scheherazade, they must tell a story to change the story, and the stakes are high.

*************** END
Many autobiographies of people with disabilities are further troubled by questions of authorship or influence, placing them somewhere between an autobiography and a family biography—in this chapter, I refer to such works as "auto-ish biographies." This chapter will attempt to read instances of disability autobiography not only for examples and instances of negotiation within the text, but also as sites of negotiation in and of themselves. In these cases, an autobiography is not only a way of conveying a freestanding experience of disability, but in itself is an artifact of negotiation, one that, by its existence, allows the disabled individual to reconsider their relationship to those around them and to society. At the same time, many disability autobiographies demonstrate an awareness of the form, leveraging it to intervene in imposed narratives or otherwise escape the limitations of the genre. At their best, these autobiographies can use the recursive or self-referential nature of the form to transcend it, speaking directly to the experience of life with a disability.

** Movement and Expression

Two autobiographies, published more than fifty years apart, provide a useful case study in the forms of negotiation discussed here, including specific strategies such as hacking the immediate physical and social environment and recasting, through self-expression, a narrative imposed on an individual by society. /My Left Foot/ is a 1954 autobiography by writer Christy Brown, who was born with cerebral palsy in a society, mid-twentieth century Ireland, where the condition was poorly understood. /Double Take/ is an 2009 autobiography by photographer Kevin Michael Connolly, who was born with no legs in Helena, Montana in 1985. Both Brown and Connolly were poor, but had the full, and often unconventional, support of family members. Both find creative ways to fully participate, and eventually excel, in chosen domains—painting and writing for Brown, skiing and photography for Connolly. Both Brown and Connolly find ways to mitigate disabilities of mobility relatively early on, but for each the primary challenge is to find a mode of expression that enables a redefinition of their relationship to society. Though their stories are similar in many ways, important differences, including their relationship to the medical establishment, show how the treatment of people with disabilities by society has changed since the mid-twentieth century, but also how the concerns of people with disabilities between these periods are fundamentally similar. More to our point, these accounts are useful entry points into a larger discussion of negotiation—that is, how autonomy can be exercised at the physical, social, and cultural places where the individual encounters society. Brown and Connolly's accounts detail encounters with the limits of specific physical infrastructure, including a few almost transcendent moments of haccessibility. Perhaps more significantly, their experiences, up to and including the publication of the accounts themselves, represent attempts to change the narrative and, potentially, the culture, to draw that thin line between the local and the universal.

** His Left Foot

In 1932 in a suburb of Dublin, Christy Brown was born the tenth of an eventual 22 siblings, nine of whom would die in infancy. When he was four months old, his mother noticed that he had difficulty holding up his head during feeding. As he grew older, it became evident that Brown struggled to control his movements. His hands remained clenched at all times, he had trouble opening and closing his mouth, and by one year he was still unable to sit up on his own.
 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Almost every doctor who saw and examined me, labelled me a very interesting but also a hopeless case. Many told mother very gently that I was mentally defective and would remain so. That was a hard blow to a young mother who had already reared five healthy children. The doctors were so very sure of themselves that mother's faith in me seemed almost an impertinence. They assured her that nothing could be done for me. citep:brown_my_1955
#+END_QUOTE
Though these doctors offered little hope, Brown's mother refused to believe that the condition of her son's mind reflected the condition of his body or that he was irredeemable as a member of the family. Rather than hide Brown in a back room, a common practice at the time, and focus only on his physical needs, she persisted in working and speaking with him: "[w]hile my father was out at bricklaying earning our bread and butter for us, mother was slowly, patiently pulling down the wall, brick by brick, that seemed to thrust itself between me and the other children, slowly, patiently penetrating beyond the thick curtain that hung over my mind, separating it from theirs" citep:brown_my_1955

Brown's bridging of the gulf of communication between himself and his family, his justification of the faith placed in him by his mother, comes in a transcendent moment of haccessibility. On a typically overcast Irish day, gathered around the fire, Brown watched his older siblings practice spelling on an old slate:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
It was the chalk that attracted me so much. ... Suddenly I wanted desperately to do what my sister was doing. Then—without thinking or knowing exactly what I was doing, I reached out and took the stick of chalk out of my sister's hand—/with my left foot/. citep:brown_my_1955
#+END_QUOTE
After his left foot, "apparently on its own volition, reached out and very impolitely took the chalk out of ... [his] sister's hand" citep:brown_my_1955, all eyes in the family turn to Brown. His mother, picking up on the tension in the room and seeing Brown gripping the chalk, pushes Brown across the final divide.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I stiffened my body and put my left foot out again, for the third time. I drew one side of the letter. I drew half the other side. Then the stick of chalk broke and I was left with a stump. I wanted to fling it away and give up. ... I tried once more. Out went my foot. I shook, I sweated and strained every muscle. My hands were so tightly clenched that my fingernails bit into the flesh. ... Everything in the room swam till the faces around me were mere patches of white. But—I drew it—the letter 'A'. There it was on the floor before me. Shaky, with awkward, wobbly sides and a very uneven centre line. But it was the letter 'A'. I looked up. I saw my mother's face for a moment, tears on her cheeks. Then my father stooped down and hoisted me on to his shoulder.
#+END_QUOTE
What stands out in Brown's recounting of this first achievement is the narrowness of the passage from noncommunication to communication. The description is powerfully reminiscent of a difficult labor—"I sweated and strained every muscle. My hands were so tightly clenched that my fingernails bit into the flesh." The shaky "A," with "awkward, wobbly sides," even has a fragile, newborn quality.

The overwhelming suggestion here is of an event that might not have occurred, and which, in fact, was unlikely to occur. The specific circumstances—the chalk and slate, the couching of the event as a miracle, the necessity of the family presence, the difficulty of the "labor"—suggest a moment, the appearance of a path forward, that is as fragile as it is powerful. Here, the thread between the individual and the universal is notably attenuated. Brown's transformation, a necessary precondition for his telling of his own story, might just as easily not have come to pass.

Haccessibility, here, provides a narrow, but absolutely essential, way forward for Brown, one that is a precondition for his later work. Brown's writing of the character "A" is maximally local—one room, one slate, one piece of chalk, one foot, one letter. The chalk is not any chalk, but "a long, slender stick of vivid yellow" citep:brown_my_1955. The foot is not a foot, or his foot, but his /left/ foot. The "one letter, scrawled on the floor with a broken bit of ... chalk ..., was my road to a new world" citep:brown_my_1955. The event is not one that can "scale," or that can be easily applied in other circumstances. And yet, in itself, it is indisputably powerful.

Another hyperlocal adaptation from Brown's childhood, essential but fragile and contingent, was "Old Henry," a wagon ("go-car" in Irish parlance) used by Brown's brothers to take him with them on their adventures around Dublin. In a chapter called simply "Henry," Brown describes these adventures—swimming in a local creek, going to the cinema, telling stories around a fire, hiding fruit stolen from a garden in Brown's wagon.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
It was a ugly, battered old thing that nobody ever treated well. It was always being kicked, knocked over, shoved about and trampled on. Everybody joked about it. But to me it was something lovable, almost human. ... I had seen my first glimpse of out-door life sitting on its seat with the feathers sticking out of it. I can remember the wet wind on my face that day as they raced me along through busy streets. I can remember sitting in it as my brothers sat playing cards with their pals under a street lamp on a dark winter night when the gutters on the road were running with water and the lamplight was reflected in them so that they looked like little rivers of gold in the dark. citep:brown_my_1955
#+END_QUOTE
For Brown, Henry meant inclusion. The wagon allowed him to be a full participant, to go anywhere in the city and its environs with his brothers. Despite staring and odd looks from others, Brown, at eight, was not aware of his own difference. This changed when Old Henry broke down and was put away in the coal shed to rust:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I was lost without it. My brothers could no longer bring me with them when they went out to play. Mother talked of getting me a new car when father went back to work, but I hardly heard her; I was bewildered. ... It wasn't just that I missed the old car so much. It was the way I felt when I could no longer go out with my brothers. Everything was changed. I was thrown upon myself at last. That queer idea that there was something wrong which had entered my mind sometimes before now loomed larger. citep:brown_my_1955
#+END_QUOTE
The breaking down of the go-car forces a reckoning for Brown. Before, his full participation in the adventures and antics of his brothers insulated him from substituting his own image of himself for an image forced on him by others. After his exclusion, Brown begins to see himself as others see him:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Up to then I had never thought about myself. True, there had come sometimes a vague feeling that I wasn't like the others, an uneasy sort of stirring in my mind that came and went. But it was just one dark spot in the brightness of things ... I began to hate the sight of those hands, the sight of my wobbly head and lop-sided mouth as I saw them in the mirror, so that I soon came to hate and fear a mirror. It told me too much. It let me see what other people saw ... citep:brown_my_1955
#+END_QUOTE
Without Henry and the full participation -it facilitated, Brown is forced to see himself as others see him—dependent, ugly, other. Henry, an incidental piece of the environment, almost the definition of local infrastructure, shows how critical individualized adaptations can be for negotiation, not only in everyday physical interactions but also in the creation of an image of self. The informal nature of these adaptations makes them contingent and vulnerable, but can also facilitate a defiance of social conventions that seek to restrict the actions of people with disabilities.

Haccessibility, as a mode, provides a bridge between the individual and the immediate environment. It requires no special permission, no approbation from the wider society. In Brown's case, this is critical. Not only did doctors not believe that Brown was capable of communication through writing, they would later forbid him as a young adult from using his left foot to express himself, thinking that it would interfere with a medical cure. If Brown's writing of the letter "A" were dependent on a prior understanding by the broader society—/das Man/—it would not have occurred. Likewise, if Brown's childhood adventures with his brothers needed the permission of those Dubliners giving him "queer looks," he would not have been able to participate.

Haccessibility here, as it frequently does, throws the tyranny of the idealized normal, the elusive /das Man/, into sharp relief. Brown's writing with his left foot makes clear a lack of understanding on the part of those that write with the "right" hand. There is a sense in which these acts of haccessibility are more powerful for their limitations. By creating ways forward that are contingent, local, and born of necessity, they show the narrowness and inflexibility of the physical and social environment and its inadequacy for meeting the needs of its inhabitants.

** Seeking Expression

Haccessibility—the creative use of his left foot—made communication possible for Brown. However, to understand the extent of Brown's negotiation, his drawing and redrawing of the thin thread that connected the particulars of his life to a legible universal—we should consider his repeated redefinition of self through new forms of expression.

Brown's first redefinition of self related to the conditions of his immediate environment and his relationship with his family. At five, Brown's writing of the letter "A" allowed him to remain physically present—that is, to not be institutionalized. It also redefined his identity, marking him a full member of the family. At the age of ten, Brown is faced with another crisis of identity. After his exclusion from full participation in the adventures of his brothers and the realization that he is different from those around him, Brown withdraws and is considerably unhappy: "I was now ten and a half and beginning to sink deeper and deeper into myself. ... [N]othing ... could bring back the happy child that used to be me.... In his place was a tense, silent, great-eyed creature who had nerves as sharp as broken glass and as taut as telegraph wires" citep:brown_my_1955. At this crux, Brown once again redefines himself through the discovery of a new form of expression. 

When one of brown's brothers receives a set of watercolors for Christmas, Brown trades for it, and, after the holiday, begins to practice. Before long, Brown has become so immersed in painting with his left foot that he has little attention left for unhappiness: "As I became further attached to painting I began to feel happier and more tranquil within myself. I was less inclined to snap at the others if they asked me anything or even spoke to me, as I did before. Painting became the one great love in my life, the main pivot of my concentration. I lived within the orbit of my paints and brushes" citep:brown_my_1955. Painting allows Brown to redefine himself as productive and useful, and he receives relatively early validation after winning a contest in the Irish Independent, a widely circulated newspaper. At fifteen, however, Brown finds himself in another crisis of identity. Brown develops an attachment to a local young woman, but finds his feelings are reciprocated only with pity. At the same time, his siblings rapidly develop into young adults with their own romantic attachments, and, eventually, family responsibilities.

*************** TODO footnote on Lourdes
*************** END

Brown, as a young adult, is once more thrown into a crisis of identity by his disability, beginning to resent his family and regard his home as a prison. In the Ireland of the 1960s, this crisis becomes centered on two hopes for a cure: the seeking of a miracle at Lourdes, a Catholic holy site, and an involvement with a nascent Irish medical establishment at the early stages of an understanding of cerebral palsy. Though Brown is not particularly interested in religion, he agrees to a trip to Lourdes partly for the experience of travel and partly for the prospect of a miracle. Though the miracle, perhaps unsurprisingly, is not forthcoming, Brown does find, for the first time, that he is not the only individual with a disability:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
As I saw all those people each with his or her own suffering, a new light began to dawn upon me. I was rather bewildered; I had not imagined there could be so much suffering in the world. I had been rather like a snail shut away in his own narrow little shell and that was only now beginning to see the great crowded world that lay beyond. Not only were all those people afflicted, but, to my surprise, their handicaps were actually worse than my own!
#+END_QUOTE

Brown's experience at Lourdes holds a suggestion of the universal, a narrative into which he might fit. Leaving aside the possibility of a cure and inauguration into /das Man/, in this experience he sees for the first time that he is not alone in his disability. Religion suggested a prescribed path for Brown, one of the few available in the Ireland of the 1960s—embrace temporal suffering and look for deliverance and commonality in the coming world. This path to the universal, however, is not for Brown:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I remembered Lourdes and the people I had met on the way to the Grotto, and again I tried to be like them—patient, cheerful, resigned to their suffering, knowing the reward that awaited them in the next world. But it was no use. I was too human. There was too much of the man in me and not enough of the humble servant who submits willingly to his Master's will. I wanted to see and to know more of this world before I thought about the next.
#+END_QUOTE
Religion, should Brown choose to embrace it, would provide a path to the universal, granting legibility and meaning through an approved narrative. His local circumstances, his aspirations, his struggle to participate and communicate would all be subsumed into a larger story. Though Brown senses this path at Lourdes, he finds it impracticable at home. To use another term from Heidegger, the narratives experienced at Lourdes, and the contrasting narratives at home, are apophantic—"to let something be seen in its togetherness with something, to let something be seen as something" [[citep:heidegger_being_2010][p. 31]]. Brown, here, is struggling with received wisdom, a shared vision of the nature of the relationships among people, places, and things that includes a defined, if decidedly marginal, place for himself. To reject the roles in which he is cast—holy cripple, pitiable cripple, medicalized cripple—he must reject not only that specific role, but some significant portion of the social and cultural reality that situates and contextualizes his identity. It is for this reason that Brown's gradual emancipation is at once greatly impressive and entirely piecemeal. Though, after his experience at Lourdes, Brown consciously and unambiguously rejects the role of the holy cripple, he cannot fully reject the roles of pitiable cripple, with which he struggles, and medicalized cripple, which he largely accepts, without first rejecting his family and community, a practical impossibility given his environment at the time of writing /My Left Foot/ and the social and historical context.[fn:down-all-the-days]

[fn:down-all-the-days] The significance of Brown's immediate physical and social environment on the writing of /My Left Foot/, written while Brown lived with his family in the 1940s and 50s, can be seen by contrasting the autobiography with his semi-autobiographical novel /Down All the Days/ (1970). The latter was written after the death of his parents and thus under entirely different social and, given the elapsed time, cultural circumstances, and in it Brown is far more candid about topics omitted or downplayed in /My Left Foot/. These include his father's alcoholism and his sexual awakening and frustrations.

*************** brown quotes

After some months a new feeling sprang up within me—a horrible feeling. I began to be not merely miserable and gloomy, but also resentful. I resented the world as a whole because of my crooked mouth, twisted hands and useless limbs. I looked about at all that was normal and perfect around me, and asked myself for the hundredth time why was I made different, why should I have been given the same feelings, the same needs and sensitivities as other people along with a practically function-less body that not only denied me the right to live a normal life, but also made me sick at the very sight of myself? What had I to look forward to? What prospect had I of being anything else other than the cripple who painted with his toes? People always thought it was a marvellous thing that I could paint with my toes and told me I was lucky, yes, quite a remarkable boy. But what difference did painting with my left foot make? What good was it saying I was remarkable? I didn't want to be remarkable—I only wanted to be ordinary, like everyone else. Just because I did with my left foot what others did with their hands people said it was a wonderful thing. Maybe it was—I didn't know. I used my foot simply because I couldn't use my hands, but it did not make me feel proud or unique. In fact I never used my left foot in the presence of anybody I didn't know very well, because it made me feel rather silly and awkward. I always felt like a performing monkey or seal.

“He'd make the best bricklayer of the lot of you," father would say when he was a little ‘tight', pointing at me in front of the others. “You'd be earning five pounds a week now, Chris, building houses, a pair of dungarees on you and a good steel trowel in your hand." I hated bricklaying because I couldn't lay bricks.


"I was changing.... Above all I learned to forget myself. I didn't miss going out with my brothers now, for I had something to keep my mind active, something to make each day, a thing to look forward to" citep:brown_my_1955.

I knew then, as I came to know many times later, how bitter and crushing a simple look of pity can be to someone like myself who needs something other than sympathy—the strength that only genuine human affection can give to the weakest heart.

# Brown's painting
# Medical stuff, banned
# Brown's writing again


# Ultimately, to the extent that Brown is able to assume autonomy over his identity, it is through his writing.

Though Brown's inspired act of haccessibility as a child was a necessary, if precarious, precondition for his full participation in society, it is ultimately his writing that enables him to recontextualize his social reality and exert a measure of autonomy over his circumstances. After Brown receives what he and his family perceive to be a rare oppurtunity—being invited to visit a specialist at Middlesex Hospital in London—Brown receives another promise of a miracle, one that comes at much higher cost to his identity:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
“Well, Christy," she said. “You haven’t come to London in vain. I can find no reason why you shouldn’t be cured eventually. ... But—" here she paused, looked steadily at me, and went on—“you must first make a big sacrifice. Nothing good is ever obtained without one, and yours is—you must resolve never to use your left foot again." ... My left foot! But that meant everything to me—I could speak only with that, create only with that! It was my only means of communication with the outside world, my only way of reaching the minds of other people and making myself articulate and intelligible. The rest of me was useless, worthless, and that one limb, my left foot, was the only workable thing in my whole body. Without it I would be lost, silent, powerless.[fn:little-mermaid] [[citep:brown_my_1955][p. 123]] 
#+END_QUOTE
A modern reading of Brown's experience with doctors and clinicians is frustrating—though Brown generally has an unambiguously positive opinion of the medical professionals he encounters, therapy for cerebral palsy in the 40s and 50s was at an early stage and it is unclear what, if any, benefits he received from his treatment. At the same time, the loss of the use of his left foot for Brown's ability to express himself represented another crisis of identity—"I felt as if I was about to lock myself up and throw away the key" [[cite:brown_my_1955][p. 125]]. 


[fn:little-mermaid] There seems something notably perverse about this injunction for Brown not to use his foot for communication. I am reminded of Anderson's /The Little Mermaid/, in which the title character gives up her speech: "this voice you must give to me; the best thing you possess will I have for the price of my draught." ... "But if you take away my voice," said the little mermaid, “what is left for me?" "Your beautiful form, your graceful walk ..." [[citep:andersen_complete_2011][p. 69]].


# END FOOTNOTE !!!

Contained in Brown's forbiddance from using his left foot is the germ of a new opportunity for identity and communication. At St. Brendan's, where Brown goes to receive physical therapy, Brown encounters Robert Collis, a doctor who was also a noted author. Collis, finding that Brown spent much of his time writing and had attempted to write an autobiography, mentored him, found him a tutor, and, eventually, drew on connections to help see /My Left Foot/ published. The autobiography was, and continues to be, successful, setting Brown on a different life trajectory. The book was popular enough to be adapted into a 1989 film that won Brenda Fricker and Daniel Day-Lewis academy awards.[fn:bono] Materially, the novel allowed Brown to live a markedly different economic and social life that, eventually, included romantic partnerships, independent living, and aspirations and personal relationships that exceeded the expectations of Ireland's rigid mid-twentieth century class system. In writing /My Left Foot/, in writing about his life, Brown altered that life. And, Because these changes are, themselves, reflected in his writing, the act of autobiography, and the assertion of autonomy, create a resonance. This self-referential relationship between life and narrative, autonomy and autobiography, is, like haccessibility, a powerful form of negotiation, one that has some capability, though always tenuous, to provoke significant change.

[fn:bono] In a, perhaps excessively Irish, twist, Brown's semi-autobiographical /Down All the Days/ also inspired a U2 track by the same name.

** Recursion, Recounting, Re-Creation

There is a strong recursive element to Brown's /My Left Foot/, especially as expressed in relation to his life and identity. This is not unusual for autobiographies of disability, though /My Left Foot/ serves as a particularly powerful example. Recursion, in symbolic logic and programming, is the property of being defined in terms of oneself. Though recursion can seem like a logical contradiction or tautology—"a dog means a dog"—interdependent, mutually recursive relationships actually inform or underlie many or most abstract or symbolic systems. The OED defines /ability/ as "[s]uitableness or adaptation for a purpose; fitness, aptitude." It defines /aptitude/ as "[n]atural capacity, endowment, or ability; talent for any pursuit." (The entry for /disability/ opens boldly with "lack of ability.") nocite:oed_aptitude_2020,oed_ability_2020,oed_disability_2020. The factthat the definitions are defined in terms of one another in endless referentiality is not a problem for the integrity of the symbolic system. As Douglas Hofstadter observes, "[a]nyone can see that all words eventually are defined in terms of some fundamental set that is not further reducible, but simply goes round and round endlessly" [[citep:hofstadter_metamagical_1985][p. 433"]]. Language, at least as it is formalized and encountered in a dictionary, can be conceived as a network of mutually recursive definitions. In programming, this form of paradox is common—not only can a function refer to itself in its own definition, but a programming language can be self-hosted, or itself written in itself.

One might also think about identity, autobiography, and lived experience as mutually recursive, defined in mutual reference to one another. As one lives, one forms an identity that is presented to the world. The identity necessarily is defined in terms of one's lived experience, and one's life is shaped by one's identity. When one writes an autobiography, one draws on lived experiences and identity, but once it exists in the world one's identity and future experiences cannot be fully described without reference to the autobiography. Placing an autobiography in the world creates an odd sort of resonance. The identity is founded on the life, and the autobiography on the identity, but once published the life and the identity must contain the autobiography. The autobiography, in a sense, anticipates and contains its own existence.

It feels intuitively as if the relationship among life, identity, and autobiography should be an unstable one. However, recursion is only a paradox, not a contradiction. Language is mutually recursive and, though language changes over time, this recursive property does not invalidate language or mean that it is fundamentally unstable. In computation, a recursive function either resolves itself or settles into a stable loop. What is remarkable about autobiography is not that it exists unstably or uncomfortably in relation to its subject, but rather that it can create something from nothing. Once an autobiography is written, a new stable equilibrium must emerge between it and the author's life and identity. Though, in order to be legible, an autobiography must attend to commonly shared or universal concepts and archetypes, writing an autobiography can also be a powerful act of self-creation, an exercise in autonomy.

This recursive property of autobiography is in powerful evidence in /My Left Foot/. Fundamentally, the autobiography centers around Brown's writing of the autobiography. Its first chapter, "The Letter A," recounts Brown's first step toward telling his own story. The last chapter, recursively enough, recounts a recounting of the first. /My Left Foot/ closes with a description of a charity concert for cerebral palsy organized by Robert Collis, the doctor who encouraged Brown in his writing. At the concert, his first chapter about the use of his left foot to write the letter "A" is read to the public. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 For the first few minutes there was still a good deal of noise in the audience, people shuffling their feet, and coughing. I saw one man reading a morning paper. Obviously he had come to enjoy a concert, not to be made listen to a lecture on cripples. ... Gradually, however, as the doctor read on, movement and noise ceased; there was silence, complete stillness. I looked down at the faces before me, but now they were no longer just questioning faces with peering eyes, but intent friendly faces full of interest, no longer seeming to look at me, but fixed on the doctor as he went on reading my chapter. They were listening...!
#+END_QUOTE
In this final scene of /My Left Foot/, we see the stable emergence, the renegotiation, of Brown's locality to the universal and of the universal to the particularity of Brown's experience. The scene here echoes and recasts Brown's earliest traumatic encounters with /das Man/, exemplified in the casual indifference of the man with the newspaper and the "peering eyes" that judged him as a child on the streets of Dublin. What we see here is negotiation. Brown has eased—partially, imperfectly, and temporarily—a relationship with the universal that is, in his own words in this scene, "tense, ... taut as a telegraph wire" (Brown, 1954). The thin thread between the local and the universal, between the feeling person and /das Man/, grows a little less tenuous.

If the recursion of Brown's /My Left Foot/ suggests the recursion of language, another disability autobiography, Kevin Michael Connolly's /Double Take/, suggests the visual recursion of an infinity mirror.[fn:infinity-mirror] /Double Take/ is a 2009 memoir by Kevin Michael Connolly, a photographer and skier born without legs to a working-class family in Helena, Montana. As with Brown, Connolly's autobiography is characterized by the support of family, unconventional adaptations for mobility, and a negotiation of the bounds of self-expression in an able society.

Coming from a working-class background in Montana, Connolly's family, for better or worse, emphasized toughness, resilience, and a tolerance for pain. After a formative episode at a McDonalds playplace that mirrors Brown's realization, upon the breakdown of the go-car Old Henry, that he is different from others, Connolly's mother prepares him for anticipated slights at school by playing a game called "What if?"

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"Kev?" Mom asked, her head twisting so her eyes could make contact with mine. She smiled. "Let’s play a game." ... The rules to "What If" were simple. At the beginning of every game, a hypothetical scenario was thrown out, and I tried to field the answer. ... "What if you look up in the grocery store, and I’m not there?" ... "What if someone starts beating on you on the playground?" ... And, of course, "What if someone comes up to you and says, ‘You don’t have legs’?" [[citep:connolly_double_2009][p. 23]]
#+END_QUOTE
At school, Connolly faces a variety of physical and social challenges with a tolerance for bodily and social discomfort. When drawn into a fight on the playground, for example, Connolly, unable to throw a punch while controlling his wheelchair, chooses to simply take the blows. In Connolly's family, and in rural Montana more broadly, competitive sports are highly valued, and with his strong upper body Connolly opts to join his school's wrestling team. After joining, however, Connolly finds that his lack of height, and thus leverage, can be exploited for a win by physically weaker opponents. Despite the fact that he has little chance of winning, Connolly and his father agree that the correct action is for him to take the punishment in order to complete the season, seeing through to the end his commitment to the team. When Connolly tries skiing as a possible new sport, he is introduced to a new subculture: "dirtbags," hard-drinking skiers with no attention to their appearance and only little attention to self-preservation on the slopes. Connolly is given a literal crash course in skiing by his dirtbag instructor, becoming proficient and even talented within the sport but not without serious injury, including multiple concussions. Connolly's tolerance for risk and pain mirrors the attitude demonstrated by family members such as his father, who exacerbates back and eye injuries sustained on the job in order to drive Connolly to ski competitions.[fn:disability-masculinity-performance]

[fn:disability-masculinity-performance] It almost goes without saying that disabled people have something to prove. There's a prevailing and reflexive disregard, even a contempt, for displays of disabled athleticism, a disregard recently demonstrated in the poor treatment of the Paralympic Games when they were hosted by Brazil in 2016 citep:ashley_london_2016. In many cultural and historical contexts, disabled people were largely excluded from exercise, which was more socially regimented [[citep:jackson_reframing_2014][p. 12]], and means of social advancement via physical prowess, almost a prerequisite for any success in some cultural and historical contexts, was barred or limited. When not being treated as contemptible for their efforts, people with disabilities are frequently painted as superhuman, again minimizing their achievements and setting them apart—the "supercrip" trope citep:hartnett_escaping_2000,silva__2012. There is a machismo to Connolly's desire to excel in sports and to the wider cultural context that drives him to prove himself in this specific way, and on that basis, and on the basis of his taking on risk and pain, one might be tempted to consider his efforts ridiculous. On the other hand, one might also fethishize his efforts, attaching him to a narrative of the superhuman or the supercrip. I think his flexibility, pain tolerance, and persistence are most productively conceived not as something to reflexively denounce or commend, but rather as something ideosyncratic, a local set of circumstances that affect how he moves in the world. These choices, and the self-narrative that accompany them, are significant because, and not despite, the fact that his solutions cannot bew universalized, or consistently implemented by others.

For a deeper take on intersections at disability, masculinity, and sport, I recommend "The Wheelchair's Rhetoric: The Performance of Disability" citep:kuppers_wheelchairs_2007 along with /Murderball/, the 2005 documentary it critically examines.

** Taking the Low Road

Like Brown, Connolly's experience of disability is characterized by a single, transcendent hack that changes his relationship with his environment, and which, even more so than Brown, requires a defiance of social norms. Like Brown, Connolly also resolves the tension between himself and /das Man/ through an act of self-expression that redefines his relationship to those around him. At an early age, Connolly is exposed to haccessible infrastructure created specifically for him. The year of Connolly's birth, 1985, saw the airing of MacGyver, a television show in which the title character solved problems through quick thinking and mechanical improvisation. Connolly traces how each successive season of the show coincided with a new adaptive invention by his father, a fan of MacGyver. These adaptations included thick "leathers" which prevented Connolly from wearing out his pants, levers at ground level to control lights, and a special device—the "throne"—that prevented Connolly from falling into the toilet. Connolly's relationship with more conventional technology for accessible mobility was more strained. Though he loved the Reeboks that came with his prosthetic legs—"you know your marketing is solid when you can get a no-legged kid excited about buying a new pair of sneakers" (page 18) found the superficial appearance of normalcy that came with his prosthetics to be a poor trade-off for their weight and lack of mobility. On the other hand, Connolly found the more conventional narrative of disability that accompanied his use of a wheelchair to be equally restrictive.

Ultimately, Connolly's chosen, and highly individual, technology of mobility became the longboard, a variant of the skateboard optimized for cruising over distances rather than doing tricks. Here, Connolly explains why the longboard, and not the wheelchair, fit his approach to life and travel:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I had found that the longboard was a much more practical tool than a wheelchair for getting around in another country. It was fairly cheap, as my full setup cost $150. Another crucial element was that it was replaceable. Unlike a wheelchair or set of legs, I could buy a longboard off the shelf of a local skate shop—a hugely comforting convenience. Most important, though, was its speed. On flat land, I could nearly keep up with a bicycle, and on it I was able to get almost anywhere ... (Connolly, 2009)
#+END_QUOTE
Connolly's reasons for choosing a longboard resonate with the philosophy of the patient rights, e-patient, and Right to Repair movements discussed in Chapter 2—that is, he can exercise autonomy over a device that is, in a broader sense, essential to the working of his own body. Another way of thinking about the longboard, however, is as a negotiation of his position in relation to /das Man/. Skateboards, because they are non-essential recreational goods for a mass audience, are cheap and widely available. Wheelchairs, more frequently regarded as institutional infrastructure, are typically available only within a defined physical and social structure that makes extensive assumptions about how they will be used.[fn:wheelchair-caveat]

[fn:wheelchair-caveat] This isn't bashing the wheelchair, which can be non-institutional, modified for the needs of specific individuals, and hacked on. But given his use case—international travel, often to out-of-the-way locales—and his relative tolerance for pain and social opprobrium—Connolly makes a strong argument for his embrace of the cheap and flexible but unvetted and somewhat dangerous longboard.


# !!! END FOOTNOTE

Once Connolly had chosen to use a longboard for transport, there were two forms of challenge he still needed to overcome to use it while traveling the world. The first, and the more surmountable, was practical and physical. Extended time on the board could be bumpy, and to better absorb shocks Connolly had a friend create a device similar to his childhood "leathers," essentially a combination shoe and seat that, in Connolly's words, resembled a "leather flowerpot." Another issue was propulsion. While Connolly had tough hands, using a hand all day to propel his board would normally be untenable. To resolve this, Connolly took a glove and wrapped it in so many layers of duct tape that it resembled a gauntlet. After burning through layers of duct tape during the day—the object was "incredibly smelly"—he could simply add more tape.

These clever (and inexpensive) approaches to the physical challenges of moving through a wide variety of environments came relatively easily to Connolly. A second category of challenges to his free movement, social challenges, proved more difficult to resolve. Wherever he went, Connolly encountered stares and dramatic reactions. Some of these were simply rude or ignorant. Frequently, however, Connolly learns that his encounters with others are mediated through their own historical and cultural narratives. In Sarajevo, Connolly is apologized to, seen by locals as a childhood victim of a legacy of war. In coastal New Zealand, a child questions whether he was attacked by a shark. In his own Montana, he is often mistaken for a veteran of the Iraq War, while in central Europe he is frequently accosted for blessings and intercessions by religious individuals. Connolly resents these narrative impositions on his own image of self, yet also questions whether he, as an outsider, has the right to resist these readings of his disability. In practice, however, these aggregated interactions are difficult for Connolly, and the way these reactions wear on his own story of self make him question whether he should, or can, continue his travels.

** Looking Back

Like Brown's revelation—grasping chalk with his left foot and opening the door to self-expression—a means for Connolly to resist these imposed narratives comes in a sudden moment of inspiration. In Vienna, after being strong-armed to accept money, and pity, from a stranger on the street, Connolly finds himself at his wit's end after being stared at, and photographed, by a group in a public square:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"Really?" I said out loud, as they began to scatter, trying to avoid being called out. I’d had people sneak photos of me before, but what really offended me was the fact that they used their camera phone. I was just something shocking on the street; a grainy photo to send their friends. Who knew where that photo went or how many laughs were gotten out of the image? ...Everyone nearby had begun to stare. Real anger—the sort of emotion that makes you puff out your chest and clench your jaw—burned in my gut. citep:connolly_double_2009
#+END_QUOTE
After these early experiences in the city, Connolly finds himself avoiding crowds. But, upon encountering the familiar stare one more time, Connolly tries something different.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
His steps stuttered for a moment as he did a double take. Still fuming from my earlier encounter, I did something impulsive. I looked across the street and tried to keep my eyes from meeting his. My right hand still had a white-knuckle grip on my camera as I held it at my side, floating mere inches off the concrete, and I hoped he wouldn’t notice the lens slowly aiming up at him. .. I pushed the button and heard the muffled chik-ticht ... I’d used my own form of staring. citep:connolly_double_2009
#+END_QUOTE
On getting back to his hostel and viewing the photo, Connolly is taken by surprise. The photo is striking, the sharp low angle, combined with the shocked expression of the subject, gives it an urgent feel. The photo captured his reality, holding the potential to concretely convey his day-in, day-out lived experience to others. Perhaps more importantly, the photo, and the moment of taking it, reverses a fundamental dynamic, exchanging the positions of observer and subject and recasting Connolly's self-narrative from pitied to proactive. All at once, Connolly did not wish to hide from reactions to his legless condition, but sought them out. 

Taking this form of photo became a challenge for Connolly—he took over 900 viable photos during the remainder of his trip—and Connolly was soon able to transform his "double takes" into a major artistic endeavor. In 2006, Connolly had embarked on his trip around the world, taking photos for what he called his /Rolling Exhibition/. By 2008, the exhibition had been featured in NPR, CNET, ABC, and the Washington Post, among others citep:brown_man_2008,beckman_lens_2008,jackson_photographer_2008,handel_photographer_2008. Following this media coverage, /The Rolling Exhibition/ was featured as part of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. This media attention led HarperCollins to invite Connolly to write the memoir that would become /Double Take/. Since the publication of /Double Take/ in 2009, Connolly has continued to receive media attention, including an appearance on the Today Show. In 2013, Connolly starred in /Armed and Ready/, a one-season series for the Travel Channel that saw him attempt challenges such as surfing, street luge, jousting, and moving in zero gravity. As occured with Brown, Connolly's ability to recontextualize his disability and tell his own story led to changes in his life, changes that largely resulted in greater autonomy.

** Recurring Images

Connolly's inspired moment in Vienna—taking a picture of a man staring at him—does a great deal of work along many dimensions. First, it renders legible to others, to the universal, the reality he lives in, one in which movement in public is fundamentally fraught. Second, it resists a forcible rewriting, an unthinking narrativization as an object of pity, hilarity , or curiosity. Third, it creates and sustains a stable identity, that of artist and photographer. Fourth, in depicting the same reaction in broad contexts, the larger project of the /Rolling Exhibition/ gestures toward an underlying reality, that of a universal manifest in local contexts. Lastly, the moment shows a crack, a small way forward, in the edifice of the tyrannical relationship between the particular and the universal.

Connolly's /Rolling Exhibition/ captures something fundamental in the relationship between the particular and the universal, the identity of the self and the understanding of the collective. The photographs, in depicting a collective response to difference, suggest an imposition of identity from above. These reactions, as experienced by Connolly prior to his taking of that first photograph, cast him not as an independent agent with a self-created identity but as an object of surprise, curiosity, or pity. In capturing and representing these impositions, Connolly establishes a recursive relationship with the universal. The reactions of the collective become a basis for a new identity. Though the new identity is based on resistance through art, it also contains within itself the initial reaction. Connolly's autonomy, achieved through his photography, is not complete independence, a cutting off of the tyranny of the universal, but the redefinition of the relationship from a form that is unidirectional to one with push and pull. His identity contains the gazes directed at him, re recontextualizing them and, through the exhibition and the autobiography, reframing them for consumption by the universal. 

In the opening to this discussion of /Double Take/, I suggested that the central image of the autobiography was that of an infinity mirror—that is, a set of two opposed mirrors that create a series of endlessly receding reflections. The image is apt for describing Connolly's approach to photography, but also the line between local and universal drawn in autobiography. In mathematics, the name for the endlessly narrowing geometrical figure created in an infinity mirror is "Gabriel's horn." The figure resembles a horn due to the widened area subjectively close to the viewer that narrows into a flute as it moves further away. The reference to Gabriel, the archangel who will blow a horn to announce judgment day, suggests an encounter between the finite and the infinite. The image also seems suggestive of the near-to-hand, meso-scale local—the first few reflections one sees in an infinity mirror—and a universal that is distant, able to be glimpsed but never seized in its entirety.

Looking into an infinity mirror, we understand, see, and affect our near-to-hand reflections, those close to us. Our relationship with reflections in the distance, however, is more ambiguous. The connection is there, but attenuated—the relationship is technically reciprocal, but not evenly so. Looking at the shape of Gabriel's horn, with one end broad and one increasingly narrow, we feel, perhaps, that every aspect of our individual reality is touched by, imposed on, by the universal, but the concessions to our particularity on the part of the universal are small, even minute. How, then, can we blow Gabriel's horn? How can we cultivate autonomy, resisting the tyranny of /das Man/ and creating an immediate environment adapted to our needs as individuals and members of local communities? And, if it is even possible, How can we affect real change, not only in our immediate locality, but in contexts that widen out from where we stand?

** Getting Across

# What is the shape of the relationship between the local and the universal? Or, to be more specific to the subject at hand—autobiographies and the self-told stories of people with disabilities—what is the nature of the relationship between an individual and a collective identity?

*************** TODO fit this in above or transition
*************** END

Brown (/My Left Foot/) and Connolly (/Double Take/) understand, as many people with disabilities must, that their stories are in some sense unrepresentative. The challenge, then, is not so much to do as most autobiographies do—hold up the subject as representative of a larger collective narrative or identity, a worthy subject of broad interest—but to do so while honoring real difference. Locality cannot always be rendered legible, and some truths are too particular to be universalized. The result, naturally, is compromise—in autobiographies of disability, it is not generally the universal that accommodates the disabled identity, but the disabled identity, the local difference, that must be shaped to the limited understanding of /das Man/. The perennial hope in these circumstances is potential for reciprocity: that, through repetition, inspiration, rhetoric, or chance, the universal will shift to incorporate a new understanding, that something lasting will come of powerful but transient local experiences.

Can autobiographies of disability really be representative? That is, can they convey local truth, some fundamental understanding of a complex context, to the broader society? It is also possible here to take an even more pessamistic view, which might prompt the question—"Can autobiographies of disability even be fully or faithfully representative of their local context, of the lived experiences of their authors?" There are powerful forces, among them various narrative, structural, and pragmatic headwinds, arrayed against a person with disabilities who wishes to communicate their local circumstances and life experiences in the form of autobiography. Naturally, even at the best of times, communicating one's experiences to a broad and unknown audience is a difficult proposition. However, of the many challenges facing the disability autobiographer, one stands out as of particular concern: narrative incommensurability.

When communicating outward—that is, not to one's local community but to a broader collective that does not share critical context—it becomes necessary to adopt a suitable narrative, one that reconciles the local context to the concerns and understanding of the larger group. These narratives are abstractions[fn:abstraction], rendering high-context understandings of local circumstance legible and comprehensible to a collective that has less immediate interest or relevant knowledge. This dynamic should be immediately familiar to any academic who attempts to convey their specialized research to a broad audience—or, for that matter, explain their work at a dinner party. Unfortunately, when choosing narratives with which to render experiences of disability to a wider audience, the problem is twofold. First, there exist a variety of narratives related to disability in the public consciousness, many or most of which are regressive and have little relation to specific experiences of disability. Second, other narratives, those not directly related to disability, are likely to be inadequate when conveying these experiences. The result is narrative incommensurability—the lack of a common basis for understanding premised on the inadequacy of existing narratives to convey experiences of disability.

[fn:abstraction] Abstraction is a term that, perhaps, needs little elaboration. However, I am somewhat concerned that my use of the term in the following sections might be colored by an understanding of abstraction as considered in the context of programming and computer science, and to a lesser extent philosophy and philosophy of mind. Briefly considering abstraction here might also be useful in considering the larger theme here—the relationship between the particular and the general, or the local and the universal.

Locke writes, by way of definition, that "[t]he use of words then being to stand as outward marks of our internal ideas, and those ideas being taken from particular things, if every particular idea that we take in should have a distinct name, names must be endless. To prevent this, the mind makes the particular ideas received from particular objects to become general; which is done by considering them as they are in the mind such appearances,--separate from all other existences, and the circumstances of real existence, as time, place, or any other concomitant ideas. This is called Abstraction" . In summarizing this definition, philosopher John Linnell gets at the heart of the matter: "Abstract ideas are framed by the mind from particular ideas (perceptions) by a process of omission.... Perception becomes conception through omission of context" [[citep:linnell_lockes_1956][p. 404]]. That is to say, abstraction is the process of moving from the particular to the general. This process involves finding commonalities in the particular, dropping their associated context, and leaving in their place some idea or concept.

For our larger purposes here in this chapter, we should take away two insights about abstraction. The first is that, as described above, abstraction leads to a loss of context, a flattening. As we create ideas, as we generalize, we lose sight of the local. Second, abstractions, as they are conjured from nothing, seem fictive, easily dismissed or re conceived. This is not the case. Abstractions, once loosed, may be difficult to recall. 

On the first page of /Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs/ Sussman and Abelson write that "[c]omputational processes are abstract beings that inhabit computers.. ... A computational process is indeed much like a sorcerer's idea of a spirit. It cannot be seen or touched. It is not composed of matter at all. However, it is very real. It can perform intellectual work. It can answer questions. It can affect the world by disbursing money at a bank or by controlling a robot arm in a factory. The programs we use to conjure processes are like a sorcerer's spells" [[citep:abelson_structure_1996][p. 1-2]]. We linve in a time when abstractions, in a concrete and literal sense, perform physical and intellectual labor. However, broadly speaking, abstractions have always had a similar power. The abstractions we choose to create and embrace determine what we attend to and what we ignore, and what questions are answered even before they are asked.

Abstract, literally, means to move away, to increase distance. Part of this project is to do the opposite, something we have little vocabulary for. (Intract? Reparticularize? Concretize? Or, as we will discuss in the next chapter, instantiate?) However, this project is, and will continue to be, guilty of many an abstraction, even more so as we forge ahead.

** Facing Narrative Incommensurability

In /Narrative Prosthesis: Disability and the Dependencies of Discourse/, David Mitchell and Sharon Snyder make the case that disability is conceptualized as fundamentally unknowable, and that that unknowability, when it presents itself, demands explication and resolution.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Most basic to the identification of character through disability is the way in which physical and cognitive differences have been narrated as alien to the normal course of human affairs. To represent disability is to engage oneself in an encounter with that which is believed to be off the map of “recognizable" human experiences. Making comprehensible that which appears to be inherently unknowable situates narrative in the powerful position of mediator between two separate worlds. ... [I]t is the narrative of disability’s very unknowability that consolidates the need to tell a story about it. [[citep:mitchell_narrative_2000][p. 5-6]]
#+END_QUOTE
Narrative, as it is typically encountered, is not forgiving to accounts from a disability perspective. Mitchell and Snyder suggest that disability reads as alien, and that alienation reads as unknowability. That unknowability, when it appears in a narrative, demands explanation—in their words, "disability inaugurates the act of interpretation" [[citep:mitchell_narrative_2000][p. 6]]. Paradoxically, the perceived unknowability of the disabled experience has not resulted in underrepresentation in media and culture, but a combination of over representation and misrepresentation.[fn:disability-everywhere]

[fn:disability-everywhere] Narratives of disability are surprisingly ubiquitous. Michael Bérubé remarks that, "[a]fter a decade of working in disability studies, I still find myself surprised by the presence of disability in narratives I had never considered to be "about" disability, in animated films from Dumbo to Finding Nemo; in literary texts from Huckleberry Finn to Joan Didion's /Play It As It Lays/; and, most curiously, even in the world of science fiction and superheroes, a world that turns out to be populated by blind Daredevils, mutant supercrips, and posthuman cyborgs of all kinds" [[citep:berube_disability_2005][p. 568]].

These representations, as they have appeared in narratives over centuries, have worn tracks in the collective consciousness, and these tracks take a limited number of predictable forms. In a powerful 1974address to the National Federation of the Blind, for example, Kenneth Jernigan argued that there were only nine identifiable narratives that adhered to the blindas they appear in literature:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Yet, upon closer examination the principal themes and motifs of literature and popular culture are nine in number and may be summarized as follows: blindness as compensatory or miraculous power, blindness as total tragedy; blindness as foolishness and helplessness; blindness as unrelieved wickedness and evil; blindness as perfect virtue; blindness as punishment for sin; blindness as abnormality or dehumanization; blindness as purification; and blindness as symbol or parable. citep:jernigan_blindness:_1974
#+END_QUOTE
In this address, Jernigan calls out literature dependent on these well-worn tropes, from the preposterous—blind detective shooting by sound—to the infuriating, such as Maeterlinck's /The Blind/, which depicts a grotesquery of sightless groping to make a philosophical point.

Whether or not there are, as Jernigan contends, nine—or five, or twenty—interpretations that adhere to blindness is beside the point. The address gestures toward a disturbing truth: depictions of the disabled in literature are rarely about the disabled experience. Rather, they serve an outside view of disability, or, more confoundingly, they provide a vector for commentary about something completely unrelated to disability. Jernigan's final listed trope, "blindness as symbol or parable," is perhaps most damaging to public consciousness of the real lives of people with disabilities. Take, for example, the 2008 film /Blindness/, directed by Fernando Meirelles, which leans into the use, or exploitation, of blindness as metaphor or parable. The /Los Angeles Times/, in a glowing profile written during the shooting of /Blindness/ in 2008, inadvertently provides a summary of the film's distortions in service of a universalizing metaphor:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Mark Ruffalo and Julianne Moore are traipsing through a trash-strewn urban wasteland, scavenging for salvation. All around them, dozens of pitiful human beings dressed in filthy, mismatched clothes grope their way past wrecked cars and graffiti-splattered highway ramps, like dancers in some grotesque ballet of the damned. ... In both book and film, blindness is not only a physical condition but a metaphor for the darker side of human nature: prejudice, selfishness, violence and willful indifference.[fn:blind-zombies] citep:johnson_eyes_2008 
#+END_QUOTE
The IMDB page for this film appears as a top-ten Google result for the search term "blindness," and its Wikipedia page is about two-thirds the length of the article for visual impairment. It is no exaggeration to say that this film, for many, will be some combination of their first, their only, their strongest, or their last exposure to the concept of blindness or visual impairment, and what they will take away from it will be blindness as depravity, blindness as helplessness, and blindness as inhumanity. Though I have used the domain of visual impairment for this example, this problem is shared across depictions of disability. When attempting to share or depict the real lives and experiences of people with disabilities, whether in literature or autobiography, one must not simply ignore, but actively compensate for, this unreformed cultural slurry. Without active compensation—and, frequently, even after great effort—depictions of disability will fall into well-worn tracks, riding on rails to false, unflattering, malign, or irrelevant destinations. 

[fn:blind-zombies] If this description makes it sound like /Blindness/ is a somewhat pretentious zombie flick that casts blind people as zombies, that's because /Blindness/ is, in fact, a somewhat pretentious zombie flick that casts blind people as zombies.

The problem facing autobiographies of disability, therefore, is not simply a lack of relevant narratives with which to convey local experiences to the universal. The issue is also not limited to counteracting existing narratives of disability. Not only must autobiography contend with the above, but it must engage with the fact that disability, in cultural representations, has been used as a medium and not an end. To speak once more of threads—lines connecting the rich local to the more abstract universal—disability, as a concept, has been used to entwine associations between concrete characters and situations and universal ideas and structures. When we are conditioned to read disability as a conveyance—a depiction of punishment for sin, a representation of universal human folly, an unredeemed tragedy suggesting the indifference of the world or the triumph of the spirit—how are we to attend to disability as a valid subjectivity, something not to learn from but to learn about?

In /On Being Ill/, Virginia Woolf laments a lost literature, one that does justice to the day-to-day struggle of occupying a body:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
it becomes strange indeed that illness has not taken its place with love, battle, and jealousy among the prime themes of literature. Novels, one would have thought, would have been devoted to influenza; epic poems to typhoid; odes to pneumonia, lyrics to toothache. But no; with a few exceptions, ... literature does its best to maintain that its concern is with the mind; that the body is a sheet of plain glass through which the soul looks straight and clear, and, save for one or two passions such as desire and greed, is null, negligible and nonexistent. [[citep:woolf_selected_2009][p. 101]]
#+END_QUOTE
Woolf notes that it is not only our inclination, but our language, that is ill-suited to depicting the realities and vicissitudes of inhabiting an unwell body, that "English, which can express the thoughts of Hamlet and the tragedy of Lear, has no words for the shiver and the headache" [[citep:woolf_selected_2009][p. 102]]. Indeed, in the case of disability, it is not simply that there is little vernacular for communicating experience, or even that stories of disabled life, self-told or otherwise, must distort themselves to some other shape or plot to get across. Worse, experiences of disability have themselves become a vernacular. When we see a cane or a crutch on stage or screen, we are not in the habit of preparing ourselves to embody a radically different experience. Rather, we parse these experiences, not as ends, fully realized subjectivity's, in themselves, but as metaphors and patterns aimed at speaking to the universal. In making disability a language, we make it so that there is no language for disability. Woolfe criticized literature for treating the body as a vessel, incident rather than object. Those who wish to convey their experiences of disability to a broader audience must not only contend with antipathy and discomfort, but also a similar sort of transparency—disability becoming "a sheet of plain glass," something through which to look upon the universal but not itself a fitting subject for understanding.

** The Disabled Condition

In a discussion of the public realm and its separation from the private, Hannah Arendt, in /The Human Condition/, offers insight into the incommensurability of specific experiences that is in accordance with Woolfe's:


#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Indeed, the most intense feeling we know of, intense to the point of blotting out all other experiences, namely, the experience of great bodily pain, is at the same time the most private and least communicable of all. Not only is it perhaps the only experience which we are unable to transform into a shape fit for public appearance, it actually deprives us of our feeling for reality to such an extent that we can forget it more quickly and easily than anything else. There seems to be no bridge from the most radical subjectivity, in which I am no longer “recognizable," to the outer world of life.
#+END_QUOTE
As we struggle with the relative incommensurability of the disabled experience, the inherent difficulties in communicating outward a subjectivity that cannot be easily universalized, Arendt's work on the dynamics of the individual's relationship with the broader society may provide a complementary framework. In the opening to /The Human Condition/, Arendt conceives of the fundamental activities of humanity, /vita activa/, as labor, work, and action. In this trichotomy, labor is the realm of activity bound to cycles and seasons and concerned with the basic processes of life. Work is the realm of artifice, of craft and devices, what we might now call the built environment, and which Arendt calls "worldliness" or "the world." The realm of action is concerned with history and immortality, that which sustains itself through time, such as institutions and, in an elevated rather than conventional sense, politics.

Though Arendt is primarily concerned with the /vita activa/ of action, /The Human Condition/ is not prescriptive, not a guide to bringing about desired change through action. This is partly due to a definition of action similar to our concept of /das Man/—that is, creation of new institutions or movements is inherently unpredictable, and the realm of action, definitionally plural and collective, does not, or perhaps cannot, regard the individual and the local. Further, Arendt's conception of action suggests that certain kinds of knowledge, as we suspected from our explorations of narrative incommensurability, cannot survive the harsh light of the public realm: "... there are a great many things which cannot withstand the implacable, bright light of the constant presence of others on the public scene; there, only what is considered to be relevant, worthy of being seen or heard, can be tolerated, so that the irrelevant becomes automatically a private matter."

If there is an incommensurability between experiences of disability and the current understanding of what is relevant in the public sphere, where does that leave us? Our first impulse, reasonably, is to look outward and upward, focusing away from our local circumstances and toward the broad political, the realm of action. How can we make change in the larger society, in the collective in which we are embedded? Our impulse is to abstract, to generalize, to translate our local knowledge to the universal We wish to make them /understand/, to make /change/.

 # We are trapped in the realm of labor, or, if we are fortunate, of work, and we wish to move toward action.

This is, perhaps, where we will be served by our early distinction between autonomy and power. As we abstract ourselves, as we grow upward and outward, as we chase /das Man/ or enter the realm of action, we are seeking power. We take our local context above and, in bringing about change, we cannot help but to reflect our subjectivity, our experiences, on those left below. This may help, or harm, or, perhaps most likely, help and harm. We are become /das Man/—for better, or worse, or both.

Autonomy, in contradistinction, does not require abstraction, a surrender of the local to create a chink in the armor of the universal. Rather, in the ways we have explored in this chapter, it reparticularizes. We intract, rather than abstract.[fn:no-words] We make the universal serve our local need. We take something designed with no thought, or active hostility, to us—a skateboard, a stick, a piece of chalk, or, more broadly and speculatively, a gig economy job, a park bench, an app that reports on us—and, improbably and imperfectly, we make it our own.

[fn:no-words] Note that we don't even have vocabulary for thought in this direction. Reparticularize? Intract? Yes, I am offering my failure to neologize here as evidence.


# !!!!! END FOOTNOTE

This attention to autonomy is not a call to non-action. We need, and will likely always need, contestants on the public stage, activists and advocates, those who will boldly aspire to action. However, local negotiation, the exercise of specific forms of autonomy, can create ripe conditions for, can presage, action. The hackig of a CPAP, the writing of a free screen reader, the transformation of household materials into a medical mask—in an age that restricts and limits our autonomy for the ends of the powerful, these become political acts, and ones that can have far-reaching consequences. Rather than "tend your garden," a conclusion here might be: "Let your garden grow wild."

Finally, we might consider that autonomy, rather than power, change from the side rather than from the top, might be all we get. We can strive to survive, to build our local community, and to determine our own stories as best we can. Every student taught, word written, package delivered, line of code compiled, or post shared has the chance to ripple outward, and, perhaps, to touch on the universal. Finally, as we move forward to a chapter on infrastructure and its role in negotiation, I will gesture here to a proposal that will be elaborated on there in greater detail: that, if and when we necessarily enter the realm of activism, advocacy, or action, we continue to attend to the local even as we aspire to the universal. In the structures we create, the grand and abstract utopias we envision, we should leave room for broken wagons, ones that can be fixed up with a can of oil and a little care.

** Fighting the Man

In the last chapter, we considered the immediate social and physical environment and introduced haccessibility, a mode of negotiation that is hyperlocal and contingent, a way of interacting with the world that is resistant to scale but which, in certain circumstances, can presage or catalyze a larger change. In this chapter, we have considered a broader concept, autonomy, through an understanding of how the local (individual and close communal experiences and identity) relates to the universal (narratives and structures that encompasss commonality or purport to represent a majority). In doing so, we figured the universal as /das Man/, a creature of broad generalities and overdetermined commonality. Based loosely on linguistic constructions that imply a universally representative individual ("one" or "your" in English, "man" in German, as in "One does not do that"), /das Man/ represents normality, and deviating from narratives comprehended by /das Man/ risks a response from the encircling collective based on apathy, misunderstanding, or pathologization.

In this chapter, I have depicted /das Man/ as a faceless foe, an entity that effaces local difference, that refuses to make accommodations, that is shocked by stories and bodies that don't fit its (his?) preconceptions. In this context—people with disabilities telling their own stories or struggling against inflexible physical and social environments—this feels apt and, perhaps, just. This project, however, is not merely concerned with cataloging slights and injuries against the local perpetrated by the universal. As we seek ways to move forward, to propagate real change not only in the immediate environment but on a broader scale, we must consider ways of contending with the universal that do not only resist impositions on the local from above, but that change the above to accommodate we below.

If Chapter 2 of this project is concerned with the individual negotiating the immediate physical and social environment, then this chapter has been concerned with the relationship, the thin thread, between the individual and the broad universal, the society as an abstraction. Our theme here, negotiation, is the experience of being embedded in something larger, a structure which we have limited ability to resist and, likely, an even more limited ability to change. Yet change, however unlikely, is conceivable, even possible. Change happens. How can we, embedded as we are in structures we did not choose, travel, first from survival in adverse circumstances, to thriving in ourselves and in our communities, to creating change on a larger scale? How can the local, at first scrabbling but with increasing confidence, find purchase on the universal?

As we conclude this chapter, and gesture to the next, I will increasingly commit the sin of /das Man/: abstraction. Our next chapter will consider infrastructure, and, while the individual and the small collective will continue to be prominent, we will also consider the position of larger institutions and organizations—specific fields of research within the academy, the academy within a broader, and often hostile, social context, and so on. In the final chapter, we will consider humanity as embedded in a larger system, an Agaia of our own creation. As we /matryoshka/ our way up and out, we will continue to leaven a concern for the increasingly universal with a continued regard for the local. Fundamentally, we wish to ask—how is it to be local in a world so interconnected, so dominated by larger and larger entities over which we have less and less purchase? Though the thread, that thin line between local and universal, will be stretched to its limit, we will hope that it does not break. In looking into the infinite, we will grasp tightly the finite. And, as we look outward to the universal, we will stand firmly in the local.

# ** Auto-ish Biographies and Dependence

# If narrative incommensurability is a failure of universal abstractions to convey local experiences, then another major challenge to disability autobiography has been, and to a lesser extent continues to be, more local. People with disabilities, too frequently, face challenges related to independent or autonomous living that make honest and unexpurgated communication about their lives, and especially their immediate physical and social circumstances, difficult or impossible.

The latter was written after the death of his parents and thus under entirely different social and, given the elapsed time, cultural circumstances, and in it Brown is far more candid about topics omitted or downplayed in /My Left Foot/.

# But by calling them out, all I’d managed to do was draw more attention to myself. Now that my face had turned upward, away from the ground; I started to realize that it was more than just the five teens. 

# It was late afternoon, and I’d managed to avoid people fairly well when I saw a man rounding the corner at the end of the block. He was coming toward me, and even from a distance, I saw his pace slow. His steps stuttered for a moment as he did a double take. Still fuming from my earlier encounter, I did something impulsive. I looked across the street and tried to keep my eyes from meeting his. My right hand still had a white-knuckle grip on my camera as I held it at my side, floating mere inches off the concrete, and I hoped he wouldn’t notice the lens slowly aiming up at him.

# C’mon, keep looking, I thought, listening to the sound of his footsteps and trying to gauge the moment when he’d pass. With the camera at my hip, I pushed the button and heard the muffled chik-ticht. I didn’t have any idea what the photo looked like or if I’d even managed to capture him, but it didn’t matter: I’d used my own form of staring.

# It wasn’t until the photo of the man came up that I stopped. What I saw was unlike any photo I’d seen before. The lens was barely hovering off the ground, with a full third of the image taken up by the concrete walkway. The angle was dramatically skewed and showed a distorted, towering world, in the center of which was the startled man. The look on his face was a blurred combination of curiosity, worry, and shock. As I studied the image, a sense of vindication and excitement hit me. Technically, the photo wasn’t that great, the colors washed out, and the image blurred from the motion of my skateboard, but it hinted at something larger.

# ...

# By the time I was boarding the flight back to the States, I had racked up nine hundred photographs of men, women, and children from two different countries looking at me in exactly the same way. I’d shot beggars, school kids, couples, and even one very shocked-looking priest. When I viewed the images on the screen, each of my subjects appeared identical, if only for a moment. That curious glance was linked, from person to person, across the spectrum of age, money, culture, or anything else.

# There was something empowering in taking those photos; realizing that I created such a universal effect on people. The feeling of power stemmed from the feeling that I could go almost anywhere in the world, and while people’s reactions may be unpleasant, they would always be predictable. Until now, being stared at had been a frustrating—but unpreventable—burden that I had to bear with a grin. Finally, I was able to find my own use for that stare, and it felt good.

# indeed, one of the most significant developments—if not the most significant development—in life writing in north america over the last three decades has been the proliferation of book-length ac- counts (from both first- and third-person points of view) of living with illness and disability. whereas in the 1970s it was diffi- cult to find any representation of most disabling conditions in life writing, today one can find multiple representations of many conditions. equally significant, and more remarkable, one can find autobiographical accounts of conditions that would seem to preclude first-person testimony altogeth- er—for example, autism, locked-in syn- drome, and early alzheimer's disease.... a comprehensive history of disability life writing has yet to be written, but it is safe to say that there was not much in the way of published autobiographical literature before world war ii. war both produces and valorizes certain forms of disability; not surprisingly, then, disabled veterans pro- duced a substantial number of narratives after the war. polio generated even more narratives; indeed, polio may be the first disability to have engendered its own sub- stantial autobiographical literature (wil- son).

# autobiography, as we have seen, became the term for a particular generic practice that emerged in the enlightenment and subsequently became definitive for life writing in the west. it remains the widely used and most (p.3) generally understood term. but because the term privileges the autonomous individual and the universalizing life story as the definitive achievement of life writing, it has been vigorously challenged in the wake of postmodern and postcolonial critiques of the enlightenment subject. early twentieth-century theorists installed this master narrative of “the sovereign self" as an institution of literature and culture, and identified a canon of representative self life writings. implicit in this canonization, however, is the assumption that many other kinds of life writings produced at the same time have lesser value and were not “true" autobiography—the slave narrative, narratives of women's domestic lives, coming-of-age and travel narratives, among others.

# thus, many postmodern and postcolonial theorists contend that the term autobiography is inadequate to describe the extensive historical range and the diverse genres and practices of life writing not only in the west but around the globe. indeed, these critics contend, the concept of autobiography, celebrated by an earlier generation of scholars such as georges gusdorf and karl joachim weintraub as the highest achievement of individuality in western civilization, has been defined against many coexistent forms of life writing. thus, its politics is one of exclusion. other critics, among them julie rak and leigh gilmore, address this troubling, exclusionary aspect of autobiography by shifting the term of reference to autobiographical discourse, that is, to discursive formations of truth-telling “sustained by the trappings of identification that have underwritten what the self is and how it has been seen in much of the western world" (rak, negotiated memory ix). this shift from genre to discourse opens to the scenes of autobiographical inscription beyond the printed life story. it also attends to the aspects of power inherent in acts of autobiographical inscription and recognizes that those whose identities, experiences, and histories remain marginal, invalidated, invisible, and partial negotiate and alter normative or traditional frames of identity in their differences (rak, negotiated ix). citep:smith_reading_2002

# in the previous chapter, i introduced a concept, negotiation, as an attempt to focus analysis on particular aspects of the disabled experience. rather than take a wide-angle view—focusing on society and the broader culture—or a microscopic examination of the body, we have turned our attention to the immediate environment. in particular, we focus on points of interaction at which the individual, or the small community, encounters their local physical and social surroundings. these points can be physical, such as specific material objects or locations. they can be interpersonal, such as advocates, allies, or mentors. they can also be knowledge-based, consisting of approaches, insights, and outlooks.

# negotiations, as i examine them here, resist abstraction. that is, they are not easily universalized, and an insight or approach critical for the survival of one individual or community may be of little use, or actively harmful, to another. while the last chapter, in introducing concepts like negotiation and haccessibility, took a more general approach, in the following pages i draw on firsthand accounts of diverse experiences of disability. my hope here is to show that negotiation provides a productive lens for exploring subjective experiences of disability. ultimately, too, i wish to show that a focus on the meso-level can also shed light on questions of society's stance toward disability and how we can better advocate to address idiosyncratic or non-universal needs.

# # imagine that you travel to a library. as you walk in, shelves of books rise up around you. they contain thousands of volumes, including discourses on every possible subject. that's ideal, since you're on a mission—a research mission.

# # as you step toward a promising section, a custodian firmly grasps your elbow. unfortunately, it seems, these books are not for you. you are led to an out-of-the-way room. the floor is uneven, the surfaces dusty. clearly, this room is rarely used, and receives little attention. inside are a few shelves containing an odd assortment of books. it is here, you infer, that you are to do your research.

# # casting a longing look at the wider library outside, you decide to make the best of a bad situation. though the volumes you expected to find are absent, two books do seem to be tangentially related to your research. however, as you take them over to a table and prepare to take notes, the custodian rushes in. 

# # "this book cannot be placed on that table!" 

# # he picks up the second book and removes it to a cramped desk in the corner. though your brow creases with confusion, you begin to skim the book before you, looking for a relevant chapter. after a minute, the custodian appears again. ?only fifty pages per day!" he places a metal clip on the remaining pages, binding them tightly together.

# # for some reason, this limitation is the last straw for you. you gather up your notes and what remains of your dignity and move toward the exit. you feel defeated, but a spark of something—defiance?—has been ignited within you. somehow, you know, you'll find a way to read those books...



# # an experience common to disability is being denied what others take as given. whether ingress at a venue, the instruction conveyed at a lecture, or the knowledge contained in a building full of print books, commodities that are freely accessible to others must either be expensively procured, fought for, or done entirely without by people with disabilities.

# # the vignette above is my own attempt to partially convey my own subjective experience as a low-vision researcher. for me, print books are not artifacts that readily give up their secrets. depending on the length of the book, it's physical characteristics, and whether i'm willing to destroy it in the process—mostly not an option—any book not already in digital form requires two to ten hours of laborious scanning and processing before it can be read. while this means that few print books are strictly inaccessible to me—though such books do exist, including those in nonstandard or archaic scripts—it does mean that i must be strategic in which print books i choose to address in my research.

# # of course, the relatively recent rise of ebooks and related digital formats has proven a major boon to researchers—such as myself—who cannot read print. access to a digital book circumvents the need for laborious scanning, and the result is often far superior, since imperfections in the scanning and optical character recognition processes often lead to unreadable text and the appearance of undesirable artifacts. further, books that are machine-readable and shared online are also transformative for individuals with dyslexia and those who may have difficulty accessing a physical library. access to digital books can also be an asset, or even a necessity, for non-disabled researchers who may not be geographically or economically situated for physical access to an institution or a community of supportive practitioners .

# # while digital books can, in theory, level the playing field for many disadvantaged readers, the experience of accessing such books is often, in keeping with the above vignette, prohibitively difficult. most publishers, such as xxx and xxx, and digital book platforms, such as ebrary, implement digital rights management (drm), impose usage limits, or require that books be read in the browser rather than downloaded, all in an attempt to prevent sharing or other copyright violations. unfortunately, these interfaces are often not screen reader accessible, and reading a book in the browser is typically not feasible for those who read using text-to-speech or other assistive technology. these interfaces are often considered cumbersome even by able users, and the inconsistency and fragmentation in these platforms also makes it difficult to extract quotations, take notes, or archive copies for further reading or future reference. 

# # it's difficult to fully convey the subjective experience of finding a book in a digital library and being, so to speak, turned away at the door. this experience is compounded by the knowledge that this denial is the product of a deliberate choice, or series of choices, on the part of the copyright holder or platform designer. unlike print books, which require an active step in order to be made accessible, digital books require an active step to be made inaccessible. unfortunately, this active step is too often taken, leaving those with print disabilities without access to essential resources.

# # what recourse does a blind researcher have when confronted with an inaccessible platform? one option is to purchase all books available in digital form. unfortunately, academic books are often priced not for individuals, but for purchase by libraries, and these books can, in 2017, run in price from $80 to a heart-palpitating $300 for reference works, textbooks, or some edited collections. these costs often mean that the outlay for a second examination or thesis project could potentially run into the five figures. unless one is independently wealthy, this is mostly not a viable choice for sourcing books for research.

# # another option is to seek assistance from one's institution, whether through one's department or through a dedicated office of disability services. results achieved through this approach can vary widely. these administrative services are often under- resourced. xxx 

# # while i have availed myself of these approaches in the past, my own methods for gaining access to these initially inaccessible bodies of knowledge are a little different. first, it requires an deep familiarity with the environment in which digital books are procured, stored, and consumed. second, it demands significant investment, not only in knowledge but in various kinds of infrastructure. lastly, it depends on an unconventional—or, perhaps more accurately, a /circuventional/—approach to access, one that seizes on alternative, creative, or exploratory routes to access. while this investment has demanded time and attention, the end product is that, rather than asking others to help me in sourcing research, i am frequently asked by other researchers for help in collecting materials for their own work.

# # the point of these observations is not to serve as a recommendation or recipe for other disabled researchers. far from it—if anything, the amount of investment, of time and personal capital, required for such an approach shows only the difficulty and irreproducability of these methods. instead, i share this background in order to frame my own interest in, and advocacy for, /haccessibility/—an approach to accessibility that draws on a culture that grew up around early computing, free and open source software, and the modern maker community.

# #+BEGIN_QUOTE
# Most of the time, the infrastructure we rely on remains politely, unobtrusively invisible. The cogs and wheels that make our modernized lives function smoothly, that underlie the workings of our bodies, and that carefully undergird and maintain the socioeconomic segregation built into our worlds all have one thing in common–they are meant to fade into the background, not to be scrutinized too closely. Usually, when these things make themselves known, step forward out of their invisibility into the harsh light of day, it represents a problem of some kind. Something has broken; something needs to be fixed as quickly as possible and then, once again, put out of mind.

# But for some people, infrastructure is always broken. Perhaps it was never made with them in mind, and they are obliged to inhabit the cracks and the pockets where others don’t bother to look. For these people, infrastructure is hypervisible, even as they themselves carefully cultivate invisibility in order to stay safe. More insidiously still, perhaps infrastructure is perpetually broken for some because it was carefully designed to maintain the conditions of exploitation, benefiting the powerful while ensuring a constant population of docile labor. These people, like infrastructure, fade into the background assumptions of the worlds they maintain. If infrastructure is fundamentally relational, as Susan Leigh Star theorizes, then it stands to reason not only that different people use infrastructure in different ways, but that parts of that same system are rendered useful or not, accessible or inaccessible, depending on the position you inhabit in relation not just to things, but also to other people. But, despite the ease with which they are taken for granted, the “things" that surround us have a way of asserting themselves–with subtle yet jarring insistence–into our routines.

# I argue that since infrastructures cannot be captured in a single frame, we must read media with an infrastructural disposition—that is, when viewing/consuming media we must think not only about what they represent and how they relate to a history of style, genre, or meaning but also think more elementally about what they are made of and how they arrived. While the examples I discuss represent infrastructures quite literally, I want to suggest that all images can be read with an infrastructural disposition, that is, with questions of resources and distribution in mind. Even when infrastructures are not visible at all in the frame, it is possible for them to be inferred and imagine "stuff you can kick" p. 357

** Values in Concrete

Infrastructure resists analysis, and especially hermaneutic analysis. First, as scholars such as Susan Leigh Star have observed, it is boring: "Many aspects of infrastructure are singularly unexciting. It takes some digging to unearth the dramas inherent in system design ..., to restore narrative to what appears to be dead lists" [[citep:star_ethnography_1999][p. 377-378]]. Further, infrastructure is large. In /The Stack/, Benjamin Bratton describes a subset of global infrastructure, the cloud, in language that makes clear its geographical, geopolitical, and even geological scale:[fn:largeness]

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Cloud infrastructure's energy and water appetite demands specific landscape accommodations, including putting data centers in unexpected locations (inside office towers, ice caves, underground bunkers, coal mines, carved-out mountains, dead malls, inhospitable islands, old churches). ... Above ground, Cloud infrastructure is serviced by torqued logistics networks of warehouses, roads, factories, containers, ports of call, airports, and package routing hubs [[citep:bratton_stack:_2016][p. 116]]
#+END_QUOTE
Infrastructure is contiguous, not just interconnected but compreised of interconnections, and in its size and interdependency it becomes difficult to analyze without reduction or ellision. Finally, infrastructure is obscured, in the sense that there are many who, for their own reasons, do not want us to understand these structures. Though infrastructure's large, and largely unexciting, nature is often enough to deter close scrutiny, those who benefit from the infrastructural status quo can use a variety of means to hide the internals of a system, making infrastructure into a black box that is intentional, rather than incidental.

The OED offers that infrastructure is a "collective term for the subordinate parts of an undertaking; substructure, foundation" cite:oed_infrastructure_2020. The definition is suggestive: infrastructure seems to occupy a level below that of a goal—it is subordinate to the purpose at hand, more /techné/ than /telos/. We also see that infrastructure is collective, implying that it is non-discrete and interconnected but also, perhaps, that it is more concerned with society in the abstract, /das Man/, than local concerns. Finally, if infrastructure is foundational, we may understand that it is necessary, and that a lack of infrastructure might preclude specific actions, even posing a threat to survival.

[fn:largeness] Saying that infrastructure is large is close to tautology, but it is difficult to get an intuitive sense of its scale. Star suggests that it is difficult to breathe life into the "dead lists" that are, in many cases, our only insight into the breadth that is infrastructure. Bratton makes of these dead lists a litany, making us feel the elipsis: "And warehouses. And roads. And factories. And containers. And ports. ..." 

# Occasionally, a good visualization can give us the tingling sense of the sublime, awe with a touch of dread, that is appropriate for the contemplation of infrastructure at scale.


# !!! END FOOTNOTE

In this chapter, we will be concerned with the implications of infrastructure on negotiation—that is, how does infrastructure shape potential action and, importantly, thought? Though we will continue to concern ourselves with the local, local in the context of infrastructure—in the shadow of great scale—has a substantively different valence. Our focus, therefore, will broaden—though we will still be concerned with the hyperlocal and the individual, we will primarily examine how the humanities, as a disciplinary collective, negotiates within the academy and, in turn, how the academy negotiates within the broader society. Here, our working definition of infrastructure will be that of /values instantiated/.[fn:instantiation] That is, infrastructure is the concrete product of collective decisions about what is worthy and, by implication, what is not. By studying infrastructure, therefore, we can discover the core goals and revealed beliefs of the encircling collective. What can we learn, by implication, from the choices crystallized in infrastructure, choices that have become the environment we below must negotiate? And how do we retain our values when we must use infrastructure that crystallizes ends incompatible with ours? 

[fn:instantiation] Instantiation is the act of bringing something concrete into being based on an abstract ideal or template. The term is used in modern philosophy to describe the concept that in Platonism is called "participation," the correspondence between a Platonic form or universal and a substance, an object or thing. From /Phaedo/: "you would loudly asseverate that you know of no way in which anything comes into existence except by participation in its own proper essence, and consequently, as far as you know, the only cause of two is the participation in duality—this is the way to make two" [[citep:plato_six_2012][p. 77]].

In object-oriented programming, abstractions ("classes") can be defined that then serve as a template for the creation of an object or objects. Creating an object based on the concept laid out in a class is called "instantiation." For example, one might define an =Animal= class, and based on that class instantiate =Owl=, =Frog=, and =Horse= objects. 


# !!! END FOOTNOTE

# In considering how infrastructure mediates interactions with the encircling collective, determining the bounds of possible action, we will focus on three aspects or facets: complexity, inflexibility, and concentration. These facets interact productively with the above reasons for infrastructural illegibility—size, for example, can contribute to complexity, while complexity can contribute to infrastructure' "singularly unexciting" nature. However, the converse of these chosen qualities—simplicity, flexibility, distribution—can, when applied with care and attention to context, suggest a path forward, a way to make infrastructure that is more supportive than coercive.[fn:other-qualities] 

Through an examination of a number of interfaces[fn:interface] —both to software and to commercial systems—we will continue to engage the larger concept of negotiation, or the places individuals or small communities encounter an environment or encircling entity. Our primary subject or case study here will be the humanities, and, to a lesser extent, the academy. How can the humanities, and the institution of the university, retain and exercise its values while negotiating a society largely antithetical to those values? Specifically, we will focus on the production and dissemination of thought, and how our infrastructure, from our systems of writing and research to our repositories for dissemination and preservation of scholarly literature, live up to, or fail to live up to, our stated values. Our analysis, therefore, will focus on specific boundaries between the humanities and the encircling collective, including our systems of scholarly publication and humanities fields that actively engage with infrastructural processes or the broader society. We will also compare how alternate humanities traditions—"lay hermaneuticists"—build infrastructure, and consider what we, as academic humanists, might learn from these approaches. Finally, we will consider the phenomenon of /de facto/ infrastructure, systems and interfaces that we have adopted but that do not reflect our values, and call attention to humanists working to resist these trends.

[fn:interface] In "'Stuff You Can Kick': Toward a Theory of Media Infrastructures," Lisa Parks notes that, while disciplines such as Urban Studies, Science and Technology Studies, and Communication frequently engage with physical infrastructure, digital humanities scholarship has focused on more obviously cultural productions—networks, corporations, and interfaces. This analysis will largely depart from her admirable radicalism in theorizing physical infrastructure in a humanities and, specifically, digital humanities context, and the objects of study here will, unfortunately, remain largely unkickable. (Though, in the case of our analysis of an interface to a proprietary scholarly database, you may wish you could kick it.)

 # As we read certain digital interfaces, including specific technical artifacts such as web pages and desktop software, we will draw on techniques pioneered in the digital humanities and New Media Studies by scholars such as Lori Emerson and Matthew Kirschenbaum. In taking in the larger context around concentration, we will draw on work by historians and social scientists such as Stephen Brier.


# [fn:phyiscal-infrastructure] In keeping with Parks's engagement with infrastructure typically undertheorized in the academy, however, , we will strive to be aware of the broader physical and social constituents of the abstractions we study.

# [fn:other-qualities] Thinking about infrastructure as boring, large, and agenda-driven—illegible—will continue to inform our analysis. 

# [fn:coloring-book] For those who wish infrastructure to be more "fun," I can recommend the /Clean Water Willie Coloring Book/, available on the website for the Orange County Sanitation District. In this book you'll learn about biosolids and waste water processing, all while improving your ability to color within the lines.

** Humanities Values on the Margins

In think pieces, journal articles, and a broad array of books, a perennial topic of discussion is why we—as a society, as academics, or even as humanities scholars—should care about the humanities. In /Humanities in the Twenty-First Century: Beyond Utility and Markets/, Eleonora Belfiore and Anna Upchurch trace a taxonomy for this genre of writing, what they call the "value debate." The first presentation of this genre is writing that diagnoses the myriad difficulties facing the humanities, "the seemingly ineluctable (and ongoing) demise of the humanities as an academic area of scholarship in the context of a progressively more and more marketised higher education sector" [[citep:belfiore_humanities_2013][p. 1]]. The second presentation of this genre is "a more positive (if often instrumental) idiom in debates surrounding higher education policy and funding," in which "the humanities have a contribution to make to the national economy (by virtue of their natural affinity with the cultural and creative industries) to the social cohesion of the country and to the policy-making process" [[citep:belfiore_humanities_2013][p. 21]]. As corporatism and marketization increasingly push the university toward measures of success such as job preparation, therefore, the humanities seeks to justify its existence by these same measures.

these justifications, attempting to square the work of the humanities with values not of the humanities, tend to ring hollow. Justin Stover, in "There Is No Case for the Humanities," argues that the humanities has not become less relevant to the outside world over time, but that the university, which once placed the humanities in a central position, has become something other.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The contemporary university is a strange chimaera. It has become an institution for teaching undergraduates, a lab for medical and technological development in partnership with industry, a hospital, a museum (or several), a performance hall, a radio station, a landowner, a big-money (or money-losing) sports club, a research center competing for government funding, and ... a hedge fund. ... What is fascinating and perverse about the current situation is that what was once peripheral to the university—engineering and technology—is now at its center, and what was once its center has been reduced to the margins and forced to make a case for its continued existence. citep:stover_there_2017
#+END_QUOTE
Stover argues that the humanities cannot be defined through external values, such as claims that the humanities develops, in its students, traits useful to society such as artistic ability, critical thinking or ethical depth. Rather, the humanities can only be justified within its own epistemological framework, and that, ultimately, we need not make a case for the humanities—it is enough to know, ourselves, that the humanities are important and "put our hand to the plow" citep:stover_there_2017.

Stover's diagnosis of the position of the humanities at the margin of the modern university is accurate. As far as it goes, too, the assertion that the humanities is autotelic, being an end in itself, is admirable enough—many or most humanists will agree that the humanities, as a project, has inherent worth. It is true, also, that there is much more work to be done in the humanities, that, in his agricultural metaphor, there are "whole fields untilled" citep:stover_there_2017. However, it does not follow that these points, conceded, mean a future for the humanities as we know it—humanists, and the humanities, might well die of hunger amid rich but fallow fields. Stover implies that the humanities, by way of lending cachet to the university as an institution and by taking advantage of historical inertia, may make it intact through successive and unrelenting crises. Dubious of this assertion, James McWilliams writes:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I'm absolutely certain that almost every high-ranking administrator at every university in the U.S. wakes up every morning prepared to fathom the case that the university is about serving the innovative needs of a globalizing economy—and if gutting the humanities would further that goal, they'd look at the numbers and make the call. ... Can you imagine, beyond the university, a swell of popular opinion rushing to defend the department of comparative literature ... from oblivion? citep:mcwilliams_humanities_2018
#+END_QUOTE
It seems relatively unlikely that the humanities, in a strict and literal sense, will cease to exist. However, the future of the humanities might be that of an institution that is moribund, a nominal shell. Distressingly, the humanities may already be internalizing an acceptance of this fate. A hallmark of this "rhetoric of gloom" is that, over the past half-century, as the humanities has moved from crisis to crisis—low enrollment, budget cuts, poor job prospects for graduates—the situation has become simply a recognized, ongoing reality. As Geoffrey Galt Harpham writes, "[t]alk of crisis has been around for so long ... that it has become simply incorporated into the most accustomed ways in which humanistic scholars understand themselves and their work. Once considered an affliction, crisis has become a way of life" [[citep:harpham_%5Bhumanities_2011][p. 23]].

** The Digital Humanities and the Public Humanities

The interdisciplinary field of the digital humanities has come to occupy a specific space in the narrative of the demise, and potential revitalization, of the humanistic project. If commentary on the decline of the humanities , and the corresponding assertions of its ongoing relevance in modern life, have become something of a genre, then the discourse around digital humanities has taken on a similar cadence. On the one hand, in a variety of takedowns and critiques, the digital humanities has been accused of complicity with technocratic forces, the marketization of the university, or the abandonment of core tenets of the humanities. On the other, DH is positioned as a breath of life, a bridge to a rapidly changing world, or, more crudely, the "next big thing" in the humanities.

Two essays, "Technology Is Taking Over English Departments" by Adam Kirsch and "Neoliberal Tools (and Archives): A Political History of Digital Humanities" by Daniel Allington, Sarah Brouillette, and David Golumbia, provide a fairly representative sample of a genre of critique that positions the digital humanities as quisling, the beachhead for a technocratic takeover of the humanities. In his framing, Kirsch provides a blunt precis for what many find troubling in the field:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The humanities are in crisis again, or still. But there is one big exception: digital humanities, which is a growth industry. In 2009, the nascent field was the talk of the Modern Language Association (MLA) convention: “among all the contending subfields," a reporter wrote about that year’s gathering, “the digital humanities seem like the first ‘next big thing’ in a long time." Even earlier, the National Endowment for the Humanities created its Office of Digital Humanities to help fund projects. citep:kirsch_technology_2014
#+END_QUOTE
There is much going on by implication here, though many of these critiques are later made more explicit. The digital humanities is suspect through its association with technology. It is an "industry," by implication connected with Silicon Valley, surveillance capitalism, or worse. In its misguided legibility to outside forces, it receives money and, as such, is not pulling alongside other fields in the perennial crisis of the humanities. Kirsch continues:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If ever there were a chance to see the ideological construction of reality at work, digital humanities is it. Right before our eyes, options are foreclosed and demands enforced; a future is constructed as though it were being discovered. By now we are used to this process, since over the last twenty years the proliferation of new technologies has totally discredited the idea of opting out of “the future." citep:kirsch_technology_2014
#+END_QUOTE
Kirsch suggests that opting out of technology—the examples cited in this 2014 essay are "word processors, iPods, and e-mail"—would be opting out of the future. But might this kind of refusal—Kirsch cites Bartleby in this paragraph—not instead be opting out of the present? 

Part of the issue here may be something touched on by Kirsch in his critique: the digital humanities is broad, and perhaps, for some purposes, too broad. "But it would be unfair to generalize from the obviously anti-humanistic manifestations of digital humanities to the entirety of the field itself, for the simple reason that the field has no common essence: it is not a species but at best a genus, comprising a wide range of activities that have little relationship with one another" citep:kirsch_technology_2014. Perhaps, in a more ideal environment freed from the austerity of the modern university, digital humanities would not exist as a construction—instead, platform studies, modern textual studies, critical code studies, computational literary studies, critical infrastructure studies, and many other fields would coexist and cross-pollenate. In practice, this is not far from the case—these are all thriving fields with independent scholarship, seminal texts, and active discourses. For pragmatic reasons, such as the necessity to be legible to colleagues and administrators, and historic reasons, such as the shared reference to foundational texts and discourses, the term digital humanities as a rubric for disparate forms of scholarship has been, and continues to be, useful, or at least expedient. However, the broad nature of the digital humanities, the amount of ground it is required to cover, causes critiques of specific aspects of the humanities and its relation to technology, or the humanities and its relationship to the outside world, to take the form of debates and discourses that are low granularity, sensational, and repetitive. These discourses are frequently based on, or evoke, simple binaries, which, at their most reductive, might resemble "humanism is good, technology is bad."[fn:same-brush]

[fn:same-brush] This is not at all an issue exclusive to humanists. Tech boosters who think everyone should get with the program are guilty of their own form of this—something like "progress good, objections bad," or, even more reductively, "new good, old bad." If someone is being called a Luddite in a conversation, this dichotomy is in play. And, while I am building to a critique of the humanities' engagement with outside forces here, I would note that erring on the side of progress boosterism likely has a far higher potential for damage.

A piece in the Chronicle for Higher Education, Nan Z. Da's 2019 "The Digital Humanities Debacle," demonstrates how this dynamic frequently plays out. Though the article is framed as a broadside against the digital humanities, it is actually a critique of computational literary studies (CLS), a subfield within the digital humanities. Da's observations, though positioned as polemic and framed broadly, are, in fact, particular and largely reasoned as they apply to CLS.[fn:da-discussion] Despite this, the framing of the article is not "CLS needs to produce some results to back up its claims" but, capitalizing on the larger discourse of suspicion around humanities engagement with technology, "The Debacle of the Digital Humanities." Rather than a particularity—is CLS, a relatively, but not excessively, well-known subfield of the digital humanities not living up to its self-stated potential?—the polemical title evokes a generality——should we, in the humanities, concern ourselves—sully ourselves—with technology?

[fn:da-discussion] Da argues that methods practiced in computational literary studies, including "distant reading" studies of formal or cultural trends in large text corpora, do not produce novel results—that is, results that could not be achieved through traditional methods such as close reading. Da further criticizes a relatively prevalent defense in CLS: couching weak or underpowered results as exploratory. Though I don't agree with all the assertions in the paper, the call for technical and rhetorical maturity in the field is timely and the specifics of the article were and are productive. Criticism here is reserved for the article's framing in a larger context of the humanities' suspicion of any engagement with technology.

** Negotiating the Boundary

In the genre of the digital humanities takedown, the field is positioned in a specific way—as an entity that represents a porous boundary between the humanities and the outside forces poised to undermine its values. The role of the digital humanities, in this mode, is to provide a legible site of ingress, a site at which to contest sweeping impositions from without. The too-broad surface area of the digital humanities—what Matthew Jockers, perhaps naively , termed the "big tent"—facilitates this positioning of the field: reliably, some activity under this capacious canvas will fit the needed mold. Allington, Brouillette, and Golumbia's "Neoliberal Tools (and Archives): A Political History of Digital Humanities" make this form of positioning relatively explicit:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
What Digital Humanities is not about, despite its explicit claims, is the use of digital or quantitative methodologies to answer research questions in the humanities. It is, instead, about the promotion of project-based learning and lab-based research over reading and writing, the rebranding of insecure campus employment as an empowering “alt-ac" career choice, and the redefinition of technical expertise as a form (indeed, the superior form) of humanist knowledge. ... While many will be able to say, with some justification, “But that’s not my Digital Humanities!" what we discuss here is the Digital Humanities that is helping to transform the academy, because this is the Digital Humanities that has proved itself so useful to university administrators and to funding bodies. citep:allington_neoliberal_2016
#+END_QUOTE 
The digital humanities is not what it says it is about. Rather, the digital humanities is the "redefinition of technical expertise as a form (indeed, the superior form) of humanist knowledge." In the genre of the digital humanities takedown, the field is essentially a metaphor, an expedient site for the forces and trends—Tailorism, mass automation, surveillance capitalism—that threaten the humanities and our shared values. If the digital humanities did not exist, then, for the arguments in this genre, it would have to be invented.[fn:reinvented]

Participants in the genre of the DH takedown are partially right. The digital humanities is, indeed, a boundary field, in the sense that DH engages with specific forces and trends— in the larger society. Nor is this form of engagement unique to the digital humanities. Besides New Media Studies, with which DH is to a great extent enmeshed, fields such as composition and rhetoric, textual studies, and archival studies make use of methodologies shared with fields outside the humanities, and study objects and phenomena sometimes disregarded in other fields. 

Perhaps mor importantly, these fields, along with the digital humanities, attend to the (frequently invisible) structures and processes that make scholarship, and the life of the university, possible—what we might broadly call infrastructure. Scholars in textual scholarship, paleography, book history, and related disciplines "study process (the historical stages in the production, transmission, and reception of texts), not just product (the text resulting from such production, transmission, and reception)" [[citep:greetham_textual_2015][p. 2]]. In /Naming What We Know/, Elizabeth Wardle and Linda Adler-Kassner lay out a notably clear precis for writing studies and related fields that is similarly oriented toward the incorporation of process into scholarship:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Writing is created, produced, distributed, and used for a variety of purposes. In this sense, it is an activity in which individuals and groups engage. However, the production, consumption, circulation, distribution, and use of writing are also areas of inquiry. Researchers in a number of fields (including, but not limited to, rhetoric and composition, linguistics, and literacy studies) investigate questions about writing. [[citep:adler-kassner_naming_2015][p. 15]]
#+END_QUOTE
Besides engaging with writing as a process and an area of inquiry and teaching as a process and an area of inquiry, composition and rhetoric also engages program administration, not as a necessary evil, but as a process and an area of inquiry. 

The relationship of these fields to the discipline of English parallels the situation of digital humanities within the humanities. While practices such as writing and bibliography might grudgingly be considered necessary technical skills, their consideration as areas of inquiry—that, say, writing, thinking about writing, and then writing about writing might be a productive feedback loop for the generation of useful scholarship—is not widely credited. Humanities scholars might use computers to do their work, writing in word processing software and researching on library infrastructure, but this process is incidental, and, by preference, not worthy of sustained scrutiny. Like the administration of writing programs, the arrangement of information in a scholarly database, or the painstaking construction of a copy text, attention to the process that is infrastructure creation is a necessary evil that, if possible, should be abstracted from real scholarship. The hermaneutic and critical method, as rigidly defined, must be read, think, write, publish, not, for example, build, think, write, publish, or, with more complexity, build, read, think, write, publish. From the reductive perspective implied in the genre of the digital humanities takedown, or held by critics of practice-oriented fields such as writing studies or textual studies, the incorporation of any form of practice into the generation of knowledge sullies, rather than enriches, the critical or interprative process.

The reality is that, for two decades now, engagement with technology is unavoidable for the humanist. This is because, for better or worse, the world outside the academy, the world in which the culture we study is created and with which our values might be shared, is profoundly enmeshed with technology. For some humanists, many falling somewhere within the loose affiliation of the digital humanities, engagement with technology is necessary because particular cultural products—digital books, contemporary film, games, computer code, community derivatives[fn:fanfiction-etc]—demands a knowledge of the underlying technical and social medium. Alternatively, technology is required for the application of a specific method (as with computational literary studies), or is used to create infrastructure, such as archives, of use to other humanists. Of course, many—most—humanists do not engage with new media, the social influence of platforms, computer code as a cultural product, and so on. These humanists, however, must still engage with technology to publish or otherwise share their scholarship, and, increasingly, to research, write, and think. To opt out of writing interfaces and scholarly databases is, realistically, to opt out of scholarship.

The argument here, crucially, is not that technology is the next best thing, and we must get on board or be left behind. Rather, we /have/ been left behind, and the modes in which technology has been exercised in society have resulted in a profound disjunction between our values and those of the encircling collective. In order to speak to that which we cannot agree with in the broader society—surveillance capitalism, pseudo-sovereign corporations, algorithmic bias, power in the hands of a few—we must have an understanding of the technological basis of the structures we oppose. Further, we must have in hand our own vision of an opposing /technê/, a craft to practice, build, and live in autonomy or resistance. At the least, we must be able to apply our core methods as humanists, our interpretive faculty, in difficult and epistemologically alien circumstances.

Alan Liu, in a draft for the book /Against the Cultural Singularity/, supports this perspective in an argument that the study of infrastructure has begun to approach the study of culture in furthering comprehension of modern social contexts:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
“infrastructure," the social-cum-technological milieu that at once enables the fulfillment of human experience and enforces constraints on that experience, today has much of the same scale, complexity, and general cultural impact as the idea of “culture" itself. indeed, it may be that in late modernity when the bulk of life and work occurs in organizational institutions of one kind or another, the experience of infrastructure at institutional scales (undergirded by national or regional infrastructures such as electricity grids and global-scale infrastructures such as the internet) is operationally the experience of “culture." Put another way, the word “infrastructure" can now give us the same kind of general purchase on social complexity that stuart hall, raymond williams, and others sought when they reached for their all-purpose word, “culture." citep:liu_drafts_2016
#+END_QUOTE
Technology, of course, is not something that stands apart from humanity. It is, inherently, a social phenomenon, collections of shared practices for acting upon the world in specific ways. Yet, since the turn of the century[fn:eversion], developments in infrastructure, interfaces, and platforms have led to technology exerting an inescapable pull on culture. The humanities may not be able to resist these developments[fn:the-dream], but it may be that we can regain some lost autonomy, and find significant purchase in a society that may have need for our values.


[fn:eversion] As with defining any trend or era, demarkating beginnings and ends is frequently difficult and always reductive. Steven Jones marks 2004-2008 as significant years for a shift from a cyberspace (the digital as fundamentally circumscribed and isolated from the real world) to the "eversion," in which the physical and digital worlds become inseparably enmeshed citep:jones_emergence_2013. N. Katherine Hayles marks a mid-2000s shift from a "third phase" of virtuality, to a "fourth phase" of cybernetics, in which technology is entwined with bodies and space, including the prevalence of ubiquitous computing in the form of overlays and actual objects—for example, GPS, phones, and RFIDs citep:hayles_cybernetics_2010.

# infrastructural turn and why we need to study platforms

# #+BEGIN_QUOTE
# Over the past decade, a growing body of scholarship in media studies and other cognate disciplines has focused our attention on the social, material, cultural, and political dimensions of the infrastructures that undergird and sustain media and communication networks and cultures across the world. This infrastructural turn assumes greater significance in relation to digital media and in particular, the influence that digital platforms have come to wield. Having ‘disrupted’ many sectors of social, political, and economic life, many of the most widely used digital platforms now seem to operate as infrastructures themselves. This special issue explores how an infrastructural perspective reframes the study of digital platforms and allows us to pose questions of scale, labor, industry logics, policy and regulation, state power, cultural practices, and citizenship in relation to the routine, everyday uses of digital platforms. In this opening article, we offer a critical overview of media infrastructure studies and situate the study of digital infrastructures and platforms within broader scholarly and public debates on the history and political economy of media infrastructures. We also draw on the study of media industries and production cultures to make the case for an inter-medial and inter-sectoral approach to understanding the entanglements of digital platforms and infrastructures.

** Breaking the Boundary

The positions of scholars such as Stover (the humanities is autotelic, and we should tend our garden) or Allington, Brouillette, and Golumbia (the unsullied interpretation of traditional texts is the only way to do humanities scholarship) provide little way forward. For isolated pockets of humanists, primarily tenured professors at the most elite institutions, continuing on as if the humanities is not in crisis may be possible, at least for the forseeable future. Similarly, repeatedly knocking the straw from an effigy of the digital humanities may continue to provide some catharsis. However, the humanities faces a crisis, and not only one of diminishing numbers—enrollments, grant awards, and tenure-track positions. The humanities faces a problem of negotiation, of exercising its values in an encircling context that is largely indifferent or hostile to our concerns.

Rather than retreat from the world, the humanities should, and perhaps must, engage with it. However, there are a number of obstacles in place to sustained engagement with the world outside the academy. These include an elitism that interferes with outreach to the public, an infrastructural agnosia that impedes larger readings of modern culture, and a lack of introspection about the tools and methods we use to research, teach, publish, and think. Interpretation—of texts, of culture, of structures of power—will, and must, remain core to the work of the humanities. However, humanists should acknowledge, and learn from, the interpretive work that takes place outside the academy. Further, we must build on the work of scholars who are turning their critical and hermaneutic faculties on a broader array of structures and texts: systems, interfaces, platforms, hardware, networks, and algorithms. Finally, we must acknowledge that lack of access is not rigor. Currently, our lack of attention to infrastructure shuts new, and diverse, scholars out of the humanities, prevents us from sharing our work with wider audiences, and makes us reliant on entities, particularly corporations, that are antithetical to our values. Just as teaching—though many choose not to recognize it—informs and sustains research and scholarship, acts of technological maintenance, care, and creation should be recognized for their impact on scholarly inquiry into the interplay between social structures and technical systems.

A thread underlying these criticisms is a concern for cachet, reputation, and intellectual capital that becomes pathological in the context of scarcity and precarity. Jan Parker alludes to this in a discussion of a student protest that led to an nine-day occupation at Cambridge:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A classic marketing strategy lies in making distinctive and less accessible the product you want to promote; some of the Ivy League and UK Russell Group universities have endeavoured to claim elite exclusivity for their research. The sciences while so doing have also been prominent in showing that their research outcomes have public benefit, and they have promoted the public understanding of science. A similar exclusivity in humanities research, to public involvement, and it has been made to seem part of an excluding agenda. ... [I]t is the divorce between the humanities elite and wider society that has led on both sides to a devaluing of real discourse (Parker 47)
#+END_QUOTE

As Parker suggests, while the sciences struggle with issues of accessibility and exclusivity, there is a countervailing tradition of engagement with the public that facilitates broader understanding of the importance of science. A humanities tradition of engagement with the public is significantly less developed. This lack of engagement, combined with the dwindling resources directed at the humanities, causes suspicion to be levied at boundary fields, such as the public humanities and the digital humanities. In the following section, we will explore some of the differences between how the humanities and the sciences share research and engage the public. Before we move on to considering a humanities fully committed, not to circling its wagons and fighting over diminishing resources, but negotiating, broadly engaging in the world, I would like to once again echo the sentiments of Susan Leigh Star in her "call to study boring things" [[cite:star_ethnography_1999][p. 37]]. 

In the following sections, I will advocate for a series of approaches that demand either a disregard for cachet or an attention to the boring. This includes a reexamination of our /de facto/ infrastructure for thought and its dissemination—word processors and scholarly databases—but also an examination of how interpretation is taking place in communities held in little regard within academic humanities. The digital humanities, unfortunately, has not always been an apt model for full-throated support of the boring. DH practitioners, too often, have benefited from the positioning of projects as new and exciting.[fn:mea-culpa] The field should move beyond this rhetoric. At the same time, the humanities may need to look to a full set of boundary fields—among them the public humanities and the digital humanities—in a contemplation of broad, two-way negotiation with the world. We need not alter the core values and methodology of the humanities, but we do need to acknowledge those who, as a component of their scholarship, take on the boring and frequently unrenumerative work of bridging the divide between the humanities and the outside, whether it be wrangling legacy XML, reshelving books, or administering a community college writing program. We are not debased, but rather enriched, by service that takes us beyond our intellectual and social boundaries, and brings new insight to bear on our exercise of the hermaneutic. In the following sections, we will attend to the infrastructure that mediates the boundary between the humanities and the encircling culture, noting how an inattention to infrastructure on the part of the humanities—allowing it to be created by entities such as corporations—has led to a failure to exercise our values in a broader context. The final portion of this chapter will consider areas within the humanities that are modeling engagement with infrastructure and will indulge some utopianism—that is, imagining what a fully realized relationship between the humanities and the public might look like.


[fn:mea-culpa] As a digital humanities practitioner, I, too, have benefited from this positioning. A 2018 paper by Paige C Morgan makes a reasoned critique of the positioning of DH projects as "easy" for those not approaching them from a supported and resource-rich context, using as one example DH Box, a project on which I am a contributor citep:morgan_consequences_2018. I do understand these pressures, and that scholarship that embraces the boring may not be what is rewarded by tenure committees, university presses, and grant officers, and there is frequently a line to walk between work that is essential and work that allows for survival in a resource-constrained environment. If enough scholars embrace the unexciting—maintenance, standards creation, infrastructure development, critical engagement with everyday structures—perhaps these norms can shift, and offer more room for essential work that is not the "next big thing."

# But it would be unfair to generalize from the obviously anti-humanistic manifestations of digital humanities to the entirety of the field itself, for the simple reason that the field has no common essence: it is not a species but at best a genus, comprising a wide range of activities that have little relationship with one another. At its most pragmatic, digital humanities has less to do with ways of thinking than with problems of university administration. The advent of the Internet has posed challenges to the institutions of academia just as it has to the music business, and one function of digital humanities is to address these issues. In “What Is Digital Humanities and What’s It Doing in English Departments?" Matthew Kirschenbaum writes, “the construction of ‘digital humanities’ ... increasingly serves to focus the anxiety and even outrage of individual scholars over their own lack of agency amid the turmoil in their institutions and professions."

# But on reflection, maybe this very elitist attitude to the humanities and arts, this investment in them as ‘classy’ cultural capital, has led to another problem. A classic marketing strategy lies in making distinctive and less accessible the product you want to promote; some of the Ivy League and UK Russell Group universities have endeavoured to claim elite exclusivity for their research. The sciences while so doing have also been prominent in showing that their research outcomes have public benefit, and they have promoted the public understanding of science. A similar exclusivity in humanities research, however, has served precisely to separate it, by its inaccessible discourse and lack of attention to public involvement, and it has been made to seem part of an excluding agenda. As that Cambridge student protest attested, it is the divorce between the humanities elite and wider society that has led on both sides to a devaluing of real discourse rather than a simple economic discourse: Parker 47



# ... but there may just be a breaking down and turning outwards of this humanities research silo. For there will be little money and few jobs for humanities researchers; could it be (I speak as an archaeologist whose profession has embraced ‘amateur’ help and expertise since the eighteenth century) that humanities research will again become driven by ‘amateurs’ (viz.: ‘passionate devotees’), coordi- nated and enabled by university departments functioning as outward- facing research networks? (As proposed in Parker 2013.) And maybe this would contribute to gaining ground in the task of revaluing the humanities and arts; encouraging them to move away from any ‘exclusive’ label; dropping arcane, specialist, and heavily theo- rised discourse; and rediscovering and re-embracing the public under- standing of humanities. Parker 48


# Public engagement – the involvement of universities with society – is a suddenly vital topic, for various reasons. In the United States it has always been part of university curricula, public engagement being seen as an opportunity or even an obligation. In the United Kingdom, instead, it became part of a New Deal, allowing universities to charge and then to raise tuition fees, provided they improved access for lower-income families and for members of minority ethnic groupings, and provided they took responsibility for sharing their scholarship and innovative thinking with the community. It is generally presumed that this affordance plays to humanities’ strengths, in that humanities research can be seen more easily to have imaginative outcomes and lend themselves to creative dissemination. It certainly seems a vitally important aspect of our work as academics to those of us who hold the humanities to be life-transforming as well as life- enhancing. But this turning outward of the humanities has met imme- diate internal resistance, more so than ‘public understanding of science’ events. One can only speculate about the causes – a deep-seated fear of the humanities disciplines beings seen as lightweight, merely populist? Matters are not helped by the anti-Humboldtian attempts by successive UK governments to divorce research from, and privilege it over, teaching. Various research audits, bringing with them a slew of managerialist discourse, have, again, privileged the research ‘star’ – often conceived as alone academic – over other members of an integrated university body.

:notes:
 # While the question of the value of the humanities is frequently debated, the question of humanities values is often left to implication. That is to say that there is frequent, and explicit, discussion of why we should care about the humanities, but little on what the humanities cares about.


# This is not, I would argue, because the humanities is unclear about its values. It's relatively safe to say, for example, that the humanities, collectively, cares about promoting diversity, removing asymmetries of power, and resisting corporatization and marketization. The humanities also, though less universally, values effective pedagogy, preservation of history and culture, the dissemination of knowledge to the wider public, and theoretical, textual, and philosophical rigor as applied to critical and interpretive work. 

# Difficulties emerge not because the humanities is unclear about its values, but because its values become enmeshed in overlapping hierarchies that privilege some kinds of work while placing certain kinds of labor on the margins. Though there are myriad such relationships that differ based on factors such as discipline, ranking, and geography, two value hierarchies have emerged as particularly damaging to the enterprise of the humanities—the privileging of a relatively narrow research orientation, focused primarily on interpretive and theoretical work, within the humanities, and the situation of the humanities within a larger framework, frequently market-oriented, set of values in the wider society. These punitive relationships—value-based hierarchies within and without the humanities—have resulted in a situation in which the humanities is positioned in a marginal role in the wider society, and certain forms of humanities practice become marginal even within the humanities itself.

# This chapter, like previous chapters, is centered on loci of interaction, lines of interface between the humanities and its subjects on the one hand, and the humanities and the society in which it is enmeshed on the other. As in previous observations on loci of interaction among people with disabilities and their social and physical contexts, many of these concerns might be resolved more comprehensively through advocacy—that is, seeking a broad change in values across the humanities or across society. With that said, a negotiated approach, one concerned with hyperlocal conditions and the practical, largely inescapable challenges faced by humanities practitioners day-to-day, provides another vector for analysis and another lever for action.

Compounding this, many humanities practitioners contend with marginalization enforced by hierarchies of labor within the humanities. Why, then, conceive of these issues, concerned as they are with the expression, transference, and frequent mismatch of values, as questions of infrastructure? 




# Liu's observation about infrastructure as a potentially productive subject for analysis is timely, given that questions of infrastructure—and, importantly, who controls infrastructure—are becoming increasingly relevant. Infrastructure is a concern for the wider society, as publics and the commons make concession after concession to privatization and marketization and forces for stability, such as the fourth estate, are "disrupted." Infrastructural concerns, however, also increasingly obtrude on the day-to-day work of humanists. Perhaps at no other time in history have the humanities been so beholden to corporations and their platforms. Humanities practitioners, allmost universally, perform research on databases controlled by corporations such as ProQuest and Elsevier. We write in Microsoft Word. Many of us, especially in the United States, upload grades and check for plagiarism on Blackboard. Though "edtech" has not permeated higher education to the extent that it has teaching in the K-12 sphere, many schools, including the City University of New york, make extensive use of proprietary systems created by corporations such as Oracle and XXX for teaching, administration, and handling student data. The first, the takeover of humanities infrastructure for research and scholarly communication by corporate publishers, contributes to the disconnection and marginalization of the humanities within the wider society. The second, the use of Microsoft Word as the near-exclusive context in which thought in the humanities expresses itself in writing, serves as metanym for a narrow professional orientation and a willingness to ignore structure and infrastructure unrepresentative of humanities values. After exploring these—issues that the humanities, including myself, am complicit—the remainder of the chapter will engage ways forward for the humanities. These ways forward draw on haccessible principles and attention to the locus of interaction, including resisting establishment values in favor of local community.

# While use of corporate platforms for humanities work sometimes reflects creative repurposing or a resistant stance against corporatism, their convenience and ubiquity frequently draw humanities practitioners into compromised relationships of power that sacrifice humanities values while serving the interests of platform creators. At the same time, the infrastructural traditions we have created and stewarded in the humanities are marginalized, regarded as less valuable due to perceived associations with important but frequently low-status "service" work, including teaching, librarianship, mentoring, community organization, and, yes, IT and administration. Before exploring ways that humanities practitioners can, and are, moving the theory and practice of infrastructure and infrastructure creation forward, we should perhaps first consider the dilemmas posed by platformification and labor hierarchy within the humanities. This chapter will consider two manifestations of platformification, a process in which infrastructure is put in place to extract value from a community—in this case, the wider community of humanities practitioners.

** Enclosing the Intellectual Commons

In 2006, nine board members of /Topology/, anOxford University mathematical journal published by Elsevier, resigned in protest. In their letter, the researchers wrote:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
As you are well aware, the Editors have been concerned about the price of /Topology/ since Elsevier gained control of the journal in 1994. We believe that the price, in combination with Elsevier’s policies for pricing mathematical journals more generally, has had a significant and damaging effect on /Topology/'s reputation in the mathematical research community, and that this is likely to become increasingly serious and difficult, indeed impossible, to reverse in the future. ... Therefore, with great reluctance and sadness, we have made the difficult decision to resign. citep:bridson_topology_2006
#+END_QUOTE
The editors of /Topology/ were concerned primarily with the pricing of the journal, which under Elsevier's control, was entirely out of their hands. The 2006 /Topology/ resignation, though not the first indication of discontent among academics with Elsevier and similar publishing enterprises, did coincide with the beginning of the open access movement and an increased consciousness of the strange and exploited position in which the academy has found itself. Elsevier, and other commercial academic publishers such as ProQuest and Springer, have placed themselves in a position of almost astonishing advantage. The situation has been aptly described by scientist Stephen Buranyi in a 2017 analysis in /The Guardian/:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Scientists create work under their own direction – funded largely by governments – and give it to publishers for free; the publisher pays scientific editors who judge whether the work is worth publishing and check its grammar, but the bulk of the editorial burden – checking the scientific validity and evaluating the experiments, a process known as peer review – is done by working scientists on a volunteer basis. The publishers then sell the product back to government-funded institutional and university libraries, to be read by scientists – who, in a collective sense, created the product in the first place. citep:buranyi_is_2017
#+END_QUOTE
In 2012, a boycott movement, The Cost of Knowledge, was organized to protest Elsevier. Ofer 17,000 researchers have pledged not to fuel Elsevier's enormous and growing publication empire with their labor, citing exorbitant pricing, the corporation's practice of bundling journals together for greater leverage over libraries, and its support for SOPA and similar anti-speech measures in service of copyright.

Scientist Tal Yarkoni, noting that the corporation was frequently reflexively defended by academics, attempted in a 2016 post to answer the question, "Is Elsevier really evil?" The post identified a series of business practices that few practitioners in the humanities would condone, including selling false journals to pharmaceutical companies, selling access to articles they do not own, extensive lobbying for closed-access legislation, and, alarmingly and incongruously for an academic publisher, organizing arms trade fairs citep:yarkoni_why_2016. More recently, libraries in Sweden and Germany have refused to renew subscriptions in protest of the poor value offered by Elsevier and the disproportionate power wielded by the corporation.

While much impetus for the open access movement has arisen from mathematics and the sciences, the humanities has been similarly affected by proprietary gating of research, and humanities practitioners are increasingly concerned. Though the Cost of Knowledge boycott of corporate scholarly publishers was organized primarily by scientists, over 1500 practitioners from the arts and humanities signed in solidarity. Increasingly, researchers in the humanities are speaking out. The Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), currently lists over 350 OA journals in the "language and literature" category alone.[fn:doaj-date] Despite this progress, open access as a movement faces stiff challenges, and particularly in the humanities. The leading humanities journals in most disciplines and subfields (/PMLA/, /Oxford Art Journal/) are not open access. Further, discourse around open access in the humanities has become enmired in technical discussions of the merits and practicalities of specific OA business models, and which largely takes pressure off corporations such as Elsevier that profit from scholarly publishing. Though these models (such as "green," or self-archived open access in a local university repository, or "gold" representing open access hosted by the journal itself), would, under the right implementation, represent some improvement, in practice they result in either fragmentation that preserves the leverage of corporations or author-pay schemes that promote institutional inequality and fully replace sky-high profits. Humanities scholars such as Kathleen Fitzpatrick have called for "creating collective, cooperative, scholar-organized and -governed publications on open networks" (/Opening Up Open Access/, 2015), which would directly cut corporate actors out of academic publishing in the humanities. While embracing collective and non-corporate forms of open access would align with stated humanities values around equity and resistance to marketization, the humanities lags behind the sciences in awareness, action, and infrastructure for OA.

In /Open Access and the Humanities/, Martin Paul Eve draws on metaphors from the natural world to explain why the humanities has not embraced open access as a cause to the same extent as the sciences. In Eve's metaphor, scholarly journals are plants, and open access is sunlight that benefits all. However, humanities journals experience other difficulties—metaphorical dry climates, high altitudes, and rocky soil—that do not similarly plague scientific journals. For example, humanities journals each receive more individual submissions from scholars, leading to greater editorial pressures, and both humanities journals and individual humanities scholars receive fewer resources and less financial support from institutions and the public.

Eve's metaphor of academic journals as plants that thrive under the right conditions may, however, explain more than just the failure of humanities practitioners to engage with open access to the same extent as scholars in the sciences. The humanities does not exist in isolation, and fundamentally scholarship need not be a zero sum game. In making humanities scholarship accessible to the public, the academy gains advocates and resources from the wider society. This does not mean that the academy or the humanities should bend to pressure to be narrowly instrumental in an economic sense, but rather that at least part of the work performed by humanities practitioners should be in some way available to interested individuals in the broader community . Paywalls, only semi-permeable to scholars and impassable to outsiders, have cut the academy, and humanities in particular, off from the support of the public. To use Eve's metaphor, the trees of the academy have gradually been starved of sun and soil, left to contend amongst themselves for finite and diminishing resources.

** Thought in the Wild

It is difficult to quantify the damage that has likely been incurred by the interposition of paywalls between writers in the academy and the public. By definition, we cannot ascertain consequences that manifest in absence—opportunities foreclosed and intellectual connections never made do not leave traces or records. Yet the public, demonstrably, has an appetite for forms of discourse traditionally associated with the humanities. Ongoing debates over the decline of the public intellectual (Posner, 2001; Kristof, 2014; Herman, 2017Drezner, 2017) and the corresponding rise of the "thought leader" (Drezner, 2017), show that the public is increasingly disconnected from the academy, but also that the public continues to have an appetite for ideas and meets this demand largely outside of direct engagement with scholars. Since the early 2000s, "academic repackagers"—individuals, often journalists, such as Malcolm Gladwell, Stephen Dubner, and Charles Duhigg who have made their careers translating social science into life advice and prescriptions for industry and the public—have experienced tremendous success. Others, such as non-academic Maria Popova, creator of the blog /Brain Pickings/, have gained enormous popularity through work, interpretive and critical, that would seem to come under the purview of the traditional humanities disciplines.

There are many potential causes for the rise of quasi-academic roles, such as thought leaders and niche influencers, that have come to supplant the academy in public life. One accusation frequently leveled at academics is an inability to write and communicate clearly to the public.. Daniel Drezner, writing on the rise of the thought leader, calls this argument the "standard indictment" due to its prevalence in the discourse around the waning public influence of the academy. Commentators such as Joseph Nye of the MacArthur Foundation and Nicholas Kristoff of the New York Times have offered versions of this argument, which suggests that professionalization in the academy has resulted in turgid and inaccessible prose and that academics have done little to take advantage of technologies, such as social media and blogs, that might increase their reach. Dresner, pointing to the academy's relatively successful response to these accusations on the public stage and the wide influence of specific academics, argues that the standard indictment of the academy does not tell the whole story. The standard indictment is more or less true of academic processes and structures—conventions like tenure and peer review incentivize writing that is defensive, technical, and specialized, and advancement is based on optimal negotiation within this narrow framework rather than engagement with the world outside the academy. Despite structures in the academy being ill-suited to public engagement, however, a large number of individual academics have thrived on the public stage. Dresner argues that these academics, to the extent to which they have found success in the world beyond the Ivory Tower, do so by behaving less as the public intellectuals of the past—offering broad discourse to a wide audience. Rather, they act like thought leaders, associating themselves strongly with a specific idea or conceptual niche that serves as a brand. This approach frequently leverages media that are immediately accessible to the public, such as blogs, podcasts, and mass-market books, as has been the case with the /Freakonomics/ and /Sapiens/ book-brand hybrids.

The success of individual academics who adopt the strategies of the thought leader suggest infrastructural issues with the means by which academics publish and share their work. Though there is considerable dysfunction around academic tenure and peer review processes, the disciplinary culture within the academy also contributes to the creation of deep and mutually reinforcing networks of knowledge, and these structures, though imperfect, provide a context for investigations that could not take place outside the academy. Further, while thought leaders may have a role, perhaps even an important role, in public discourse, they largely do not replace either the public intellectual or the academic specialist. The gated, proprietary, and inaccessible nature of much academic scholarship has led to piecemeal, inadequate representation of academic work to the public. Manifestations of this dynamic are overhyped and undercited journalistic coverage of academic advances and the rise of simplifiers and repackagers such as Malcolm Gladwell citep:fitts_gladwellian_2013,gray_malcolm_2013. Neither the academy nor the public are enriched by the rise of these intermediaries. Knowledge received by the public in this way is at best oversimplified and at worst distorted or erroneous, and good will and market value tends to accrue to the intermediary rather than support the waning reputation and coffers of the academy or academics. Humanities, again, is hit particularly hard by this dynamic. While disciplines such as physics, economics, and psychology receive dedicated, if sometimes inadequate, coverage from thought leaders and the press, the humanities is only sparsely served in the modern media environment.

We will shortly return to the issue of inaccessibility and gatekeeping, facilitated by proprietary infrastructure and business models, in scholarly publication and discourse. However, at this stage one might reasonably ask: is there appetite for humanistic, and specifically critical and hermaneutic, thought outside the academy? In engaging with humanities work outside the academy, what I will call here "lay hermaneutics," we will encounter interest in critical and interpretive work. This includes both the emergence of alternate traditions (such as TV Tropes or the "lore" movement), but also some signs of a willingness to engage with approaches as they are practiced within humanities disciplines. This exploration will show that we are not alone—lay humanists are out there, and arguably more critical and hermaneutic work is taking place outside the academy than in it. But engagement with the lay hermaneutic will also suggest alternate and contrasting infrastructural models, and we may find that humanities can be practiced using modes of sharing that are more accessible, sustainable, and inclusive then our ow.n

# Those scholars, and scholarly fields, who do not embrace the brand-ready methods of the thought leader frequently find their work packaged up and sold by another willing to frame it for public consumption. Though academics such as Daniel Kahneman (/Thinking Fast and Slow/) and Thomas Piketty (/Capital in the Twenty-First Century/) have written (relatively) accessible books that circulate outside the academy, their moderate success

# Indeed, a broad variety of academics that have seenn wide public success, including , have nonetheless spawned their own cottage industries of explicators and repackagers. Many of these imitators sell far more units than the original work, despite the relative accessibility by academic standards of the originals.

 # Nonetheless, it is not surprising that a cohort of intellectual intermediaries has sprung up between academics and the public when the overwhelming majority of academic writing is siloed behind ruinously expensive and technically awkward paywalls. When reflecting that most academic writing can only be accessed by those with a truly wide array of privileges—socioeconomic status, geographical situation, technical knowledge, professional credentials, cognitive ability, and normative sensory and motor capability—it is not surprising that academic work and public intellectual life have diverged.

** Lay Hermaneutics

# old stuff
:notes:
# The rise of idea arbitrage—buying thought and analysis low and, after applying a figurative coat of paint, selling high—is one development that shows the relative inaccessibility of academic writing to the wider society. Though popularizers such as Gladwell have been criticized for distorting and cherrypicking academic research (Gray, 2013; Fitts, 2013), their work is still recognizable as drawing on disciplinary authority and traditions. 
:end:

From the perspective of a humanist operating from within the academy, lay critical, interpretive, or hermaneutic traditions can be, and tend to be, trivially dismissed. Most obviously, interpretive work taking place outside the academy disregards the interdependent citations and precedential attribution of ideas on which academic authority rests. In deploying ideas but not linking them to prior academic scholarship, lay hermeneuticists tend to read as ignorant or naive. As a corollary, lay hermaneutic communities on the modern web can manifest a notable (for purposes of academic authority) disregard for the association of ideas with people—what academics[fn:academic-scholar-distinction] call attribution. While lay interpretive practices may be citational, and even densely so, much knowledge is not attributed but held in common in structures such as wikis, copypasta, or memes. Worst, for purposes of academic credibility, is the amateurism of these communities in the classic sense of the word. Lay hermeneuticists love their subjects, and mostly do not maintain the critical distance demanded by academic propriety, especially when those subjects are not seen to have intrinsic literary or cultural merit: "Read James Joyce’s Ulysses 100 times, write essays about it, parse it endlessly with strangers on the Internet, and you’re a scholar, but do the same thing with a videogame and you’re a ... fanboy" citep:macdonald_you_2016.

[fn:academic-scholar-distinction] For purposes of this section, I'll reserve the word "academic" for those studying the humanities from within our familiar institutions of higher learning. Though lay hermeneuticists do not typically self-identify with the word "scholar," I think it unfair to employ the term only for those producing knowledge within the structures of the academy.


# !!! END FOOTNOTE



In lay hermaneutic communities, interpretation cannot be easily seperated from fandom, a relationship that makes such work suspect within the academy. This dynamic is perhaps best seen in the disposition of academic humanities toward Sherlockiana, or the creation of non-canonical works about Sherlock Holmes and the Sherlockian game[fn:predates], or the application, sometimes faux-serious, of hermaneutic methods to the Holmes canon. Ed Wiltse eloquently sums up the relationship between lay hermaneutic traditions such as the Sherlockian game and the more authorial interpretive tradition practiced within humanities disciplines:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
... the Holmes stories have always occupied a place between high and mass culture, just as so much Sherlockiana lies between "fan" writing and "criticism." ... Perhaps this accounts for current criticism's inability either to include or exclude Sherlockiana (they're in the MLA Bibliography but we don't have to cite them [[citep:wiltse_so_1998][p. 119]]
#+END_QUOTE
Extradisciplinary interpretive traditions such as the Sherlockian game have been around long enough, are large enough, and have enough impetus behind them that they do, somewhat more than occasionally, rise to the attention of practicing academics in the humanities. Despite this, the academic stance toward these alternate traditions is that there is little or nothing to be learned from them. Wiltse, though an academic with a scholarly interest in Sherlockiana, was dismayed to find that a journal engaged in the Sherlockian game was cluttering up his searches on scholarly databases:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The long-standing tradition among Sherlockians of publishing the results of their studies, not only in the usual fan media (newsletters, fan magazines, and these days, the Internet), but also in monographs and refereed journals creates a unique problem for academic critics of the stories. Surely I am not the first person to find to his dismay not the expected few dozen references to the Holmes stories in the MLA Bibliography for the past two decades, but a few hundred, the vast majority of which refer to articles in /The Baker Street Journal/ (the best-known Sherlockian journal, and the only one indexed by MLA).
#+END_QUOTE
Though, as Wilsi acknowledges, there is an elitism to the prevailing academic disregard for lay contributions to knowledge on specialized subjects, I will not argue here that academics need to fully incorporate contributions made by alternate traditions .[fn:not-arguging-against] There may be legitimate reasons for not incorporating knowledge produced by groups with diverging aims, norms, and methodologies into a disciplinary network of authority based on interdependent citations. Rather, my focus here is infrastructural. Even if we do not incorporate knowledge produced in alternate traditions, we have much to learn about how that knowledge is produced, and, in particular, how it is shared with the broader society. Unlike our disciplines, which tolerate and even embrace inaccessible and exclusory models for research and publication, lay hermaneutic traditions tend to be less walled in, and the knowledge they produce is more available to society. While we should not adopt their methods wholesale—sustainability, for example, is not exactly the watchword of the online lore movement—these alternate infrastructural modes might, at least, allow us to look at our own approach to research and publication with an eye toward improvement.


[fn:not-arguging-against] Though I'm not arguing against it, either.


# !!! END FOOTNOTE

[fn:predates] A strong case can be made that the Sherlockian game, which models itself after interpretive methods developed for biblical hermaneutics, is a longer tradition than that of interpretation within the discipline of English. Though English as a discipline predates the Holmes canon and the Sherlockian game, we mostly did not turn our attention toward interpretation until the shift away from philology after World War I. (On the other hand, English as a discipline might claim a longer tradition through the practices of rhetorical analysis and oratory. On the other other hand, the Sherlockian game has approximately equal claim to these antecedents.)
The Sherlockian game began in a mock-serious or deadpan mode, and participants were conscious of the juxtaposition between highly serious interpretation and its subject, which was considered to be frivolous.

** Lore Communities

"Lore," as used as a term of art on the web, is the collected diegetic information about a work, especially a game. According to a popular entry on Urban Dictionary, lore is "[t]he collective history and the sum of all knowledge available about a certain fantasy or sci-fi universe" citep:twyzeas_lore_2015. That is, lore is the body of information, such as history, that operates as information or history /inside/ a work, and which is independent of information /about/ the work. To once again use the Holmes stories as an example, a discussion about whether Dr. Watson was shot in the shoulder or leg at the Battle of Maiwand would be a question of lore, while a discussion of Conan Doyle's motivations for killing off Sherlock Holmes would not be based on lore.

Lore, as created for games and adjacent works, is made in anticipation of hermaneutic readings and approaches. That is, lore—as constructed by authors and creators—assumes an audience interested in catalogue, critique, and theory. Hermaneutic activity around games is complicated by the fact that, according to new media scholar David Ciccoricco, "even those videogames that are commonly considered "pure action" may require consultation of the classical hermeneutic tradition to be "understood to the full" citep:ciccoricco_games_2010. That is, the consumption of many modern games requires specific literacy's, including the consultation of glosses and commentaries, and in that sense is hermaneutic in the sense of the classical, philosophical, or biblical traditions. Other works demand, for full or even adequate engagement, an attention to the hermaneutic more in keeping with the interpretive tradition as practiced in contemporary humanities disciplines. For example, a naive playthrough of the 2011 /Dark Souls/, a game with a strikingly devoted lore community[fn:dark-souls], is disappointing and even, by all appearances, nonsensical. If the player follows instructions explicitly given by characters in the game, they learn little and, in the final moments of a long and notoriously difficult game, burn themselves alive to support a corrupt and decrepit status quo. However, if the player is interpretively inclined, attending to clues in the description of artifacts, patterns and inconsistencies in architecture, and the internally consistent redefinition of specific thematic terms ("humanity," "fire," "profane"), they can piece together their position in the larger context and choose an alternate path. In /The Stanley Parable, Dark Souls, and Intended Play/, lay theorist Dan Olson notes that "a reading of Dark Souls must encompass not just the nominal story but also a breadth of possibilities and how those possibilities alter the meaning. This added complexity means games as texts are harder to encompass" citep:olson_stanley_2017.

[fn:dark-souls] There is no unified lore community, just as there is no single "fandom" community. It may be true that there is a lore movement in the sense that the rise of lore as a concept has seeded a variety of communities who care deeply about the lore of specific works, but there is generally not (yet?) a consciousness of lore as a phenomenon, practice, or organizing principle.

In this section, I mostly use as an example /Dark Souls/, the 2011 game that is, perhaps, best associated with lore activity, and which can be more directly compared to hermaneutic and interpretive work in the academic humanities. Another valid choice would have been, for example, /Undertale/, which has a more woman- and queer-identifying community, and which demands a similar level of interpretive engagement on the part of a player. Lore activity around /Undertale/, however, is difficult to prise apart from other activity within the fandom, such as the creation of fanfiction.

Likely due to the rise of community-oriented online platforms, an increasing number of works anticipate, or even demand, a hermaneutic approach. Authors and creators, aware of this emerging dynamic, put out works in which the primary action is below the surface. As one lay commentator observed, "/Dark Souls/ players fought side by side in crumbling ruins, crystal caverns, and basalt hellscapes, but it was the wikis and forums where the community came together to excavate the game’s delphic depths. In a time where many games’ secrets are laid bare just days after release, Dark Souls evoked memories of playground whispered cheatcodes, of arcane riddles, and of design confident enough to bury its most surprising encounters. For many, the game captured a certain nostalgic essentiality. And perhaps ... this is the quality that ensured its ubiquitous metaphorization" citep:rueben_dark_2018. Just as Joyce wrote in full anticipation of a scholarly discussion forming around /Ulysses/, these works are created in confidence that a corpus of secondary texts will grow up around them.

:notes:
# These approaches vary widely by the specific work, some offering compendious information, history, and internal texts (/Skyrim/, /Mass Effect/), while others offer hints and scraps (/Shadow of the Colossus/, /Dark Souls/). 
:end:

Perhaps due to the specific hermaneutic, interpretive, and performative demands of games, lore communities make use of a wide variety of infrastructure, most specifically wikis, forums, video essays, chat services, and backer platforms (Patreon, Kickstarter). It's tempting to say that platforms such as YouTube are a natural place for discussion of lore given the difficulties associated with citation of games and a need to use one audiovisual medium to adress another. However, video essays are more likely to be a medium of choice because YouTube is simply where receptive audiences congregate in numbers. Viewership of (often highly theoretical or abstract) video essays can be, and frequently are, astronomical, and especially by comparison to reader ship of academic journals or monographs. Academic readership, a number presumably higher than citation counts, goes mostly untracked. /PMLA/ claims a "circulation of 27,801, ... among the largest for a humanities journal" citep:pmla_advertising_2020. and a generous upper bound on the readership of the most widely discussed papers in the academic humanities would be in the thousands. In contrast, VaatiVidya, who has been called "the poet lauriat of /Dark Souls/" and whose videos are primarily interpretive, has 1.58 million YouTube subscribers, including viewership on specific videos in excess of 3,500,000[fn:large-numbers], and makes a substantial living from 1,220 donors who have committed to ongoing support on Patreon. The disparity in reach here is difficult to overstate: it is conceivable that the collective viewership of VaatiVidya, a single creator and by no means unique, may exceed the collective combined readership of every article published in any humanities journal for at least the last two decades.

[fn:large-numbers] Just to be clear here, these aren't videos of dancing cats. More than three million people are engaging with, to choose one representative example, an in-depth analysis of a single arch as it appears in the game. For myself, a non-specialist in /Dark Souls/ lore, these videos are, frankly, pretty boring, in the way that specialist work is frequently tiresome to outsiders. My point here is that there is substantial interest in hermaneutic work in non-academic communities, and that in specific ways lay hermaneutic traditions such as lore have developed their ability to engage the encircling society with a success that should cause us to reflect on specific exclusory practices in the academic humanities.


# !!!! FOOTNOTES !!!!

The point here is not to shame the academic humanities for its lack of reach, though perhaps some small amount of shame is warranted. However, as we will see in coming sections, the choices we have made in the academy around publication, and in particular in the infrastructure we use to share our research with one another and the world, are not cutting us off from a public that is uninterested in hermaneutic work, interpretation, or a search for meaning. Rather, they are starved for it, at the same moment that we in the academic humanities are starved for want of the support of the public.

Another conclusion we should not draw when comparing ourselves to lay hermaneutic communities is that we must, or should, adopt their methods wholesale, or even in great part. Specific lore communities may be engaged, accessible, energized, and popular where the academic humanities is cut off, demoralized, and—let us just say it—irrelevant. However, they are also unstable and unsustainable, their memory as a collective or an institution short and their works largely ephemeral. Though the best work of these communities may be insightful, the structure of these communities is such that methodology is largely ignored and sloppy or naive thinking is endemic. The best work done within the academic humanities, whether theoretical or interpretive, could not happen in a context similar to that of a lore community.

In the next sections, we will "read" a piece of lay hermaneutic infrastructure, the website and online community /TV Tropes/, considering as we do the ecology it encourages and the assumptions and values it reveals in its construction. Here, the medium is the discipline, the logics of the platform both reflecting and influencing the shape of the community. In a further section, we will similarly engage with the interface to a proprietary scholarly database, unfortunately our current interface between the academic humanities and an interested member of the public. As we conclude our examination of negotiation between the academic humanities and the encircling collective, we will highlight instances of concerted engagement with infrastructure within the academic humanities and briefly imagine a realized humanities infrastructure that reflects our values.

# More alien to the traditions of the academy and more indicative of the weakness of humanities infrastructure for performing research and engaging with the wider society, however, is the rise of traditions of critical and interpretive activity independent of the academy. 

# These developing interpretive traditions, often associated with specific subcultures or fan communities, demonstrate broad engagement and a level of infrastructural awareness rarely matched by academics. While terms such as "outsider art" and "architecture naïve" have been used to describe creative work that falls outside of any established tradition, for various reasons—condescension notwithstanding—equivalent terms do not readily apply to non-academic communities built around interpretive activity. Indeed, given the popularity of such communities, a case could be made that humanities practitioners working within the academy are the outsiders. A more appropriate term for these rising interpretative communities might be "lay hermaneutics."

TV Tropes is, in its own words, the "all-devouring pop-culture wiki," which "catalogs and cross-references recurrent plot devices, archetypes, and tropes in all forms of media" " citep:tv_tropes_tv_2020. The site, which receives about 2 million unique visitors per month, was started in 2004 as an offshoot of discussion of conventions in media on a forum for fans of /Buffy the Vampire Slayer/. Though tropers, as participants call themselves, started off analyzing patterns in television, the site now encompasses analysis of works across a wide variety of media, from literature and film to "real life," which apparently adheres to storytelling conventions often enough to qualify as a medium in its own right.

The site is organized around articles which fall into one of two primary categories: tropes—narrative devices or conventions used in media—and works—discrete media such as a series, movie or novel. Each article consists of a description, typically written in a breezy yet authoritative style and densely peppered with links to works and other tropes, followed by an examples section, arguably the most distinctive feature of the site. For trope articles, this section enumerates works that exhibit the trope. For works, this section lists the tropes that apply. In other words, trope pages are supported with relevant works, and pages on works list the tropes that appear or apply. Further, trope pages orient readers to the trope's position in a larger constellation of tropes by providing tropes related or contrasting tropes, or by pointing out metatropes or subtropes.

I'll argue here that TV Tropes is, more than the online lore community or the Sherlockian game, disciplinary in the sense that we mean it within the academy, and that this disciplinarity is paired with a marked, and markedly successful, accessibility. This argument, however, will be more legible following a reading of the structure of a specific trope page[fn:rabbit-hole]. Though there are over 42,000 trope pages on the site, we'll briefly engage with "Ontological Mystery,"[fn:highbrow], a trope related to abstract settings used in philosophical and existentialist works such as /Waiting for Godot/, Dante's /Inferno/, and the 1979 /The Prisoner/.

[fn:rabbit-hole] I, personally, find that research on TV Tropes is difficult, since the interlinked nature of the site has one moving from page to page almost without thought. Minutes rapidly turn into hours.

On opening the page for "Ontological Mystery," the most prominent initial features are the title, an epitaph, and a prose description of the trope. The epitaph, a quote from a Talking Heads song, introduces the trope: "... And you may ask yourself, 'Well, how did I get here?'" The description, seemingly the core of the page, is relatively short:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The characters are locked in a strange room, have no idea how they got there, why they're there, or how to get out, nor do they know exactly who is behind their predicament, if anyone. ... The main thrust of such stories is the investigation of the restricted environment in which the characters find themselves, with the goal of mastering it, revealing its secrets, and eventually escaping. Often those approaching the truth are sharply yanked back. ... The genre is usually a metaphor for the unknowns and Big Questions of Real Life: what is my purpose, why are we here, what can be done to solve the unsolvable?
#+END_QUOTE
Following this, the description begins to place the article in the context of a broader constellation of tropes. (Note that, as per the convention on the TV Tropes website, trope names are set apart, not only through title case but in their status as anchor text for hyperlinks.)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
May overlap with Small, Secluded World, World Limited to the Plot, Alternate Universe, Planet of Hats, Adventure Towns or Lotus-Eater Machine. Almost always employs Failure Is the Only Option and a veritable swarm of Schrodinger's Butterflies to obfuscate issues. There's usually a Straw Nihilist in the cast saying it's all pointless. ... Compare Epiphanic Prison. Contrast Eerily Out-of-Place Object, for non-personal ontological mysteries.
#+END_QUOTE
Following this context, and initially hidden in "accordion" drawers representing media such as "Literature," "Live-Action TV," and "Toys," are examples of works employing the trope and the accompanying presentation of the trope in the work.

However, while the initial description of the trope that opens the article, and the examples that close it, are critical, the essential core of TV Tropes as a form of disciplinary infrastructure is the context, the situation of the article at a specific node in the network. In the article "Epiphanic Prison," for example, we learn that a common way that ontological mysteries are resolved is through a protagonist's epiphany. In "Eerily Out-of-Place Object," we find that Ontological Mystery is relevant "when the thing you find somewhere [that] you can't explain ... is yourself."

We will return, shortly, to one or two other notable features of this page as we reflect on the accessibility of the site. We begin to see here, however, the essence of TV Tropes as infrastructure, and as an instantiation of values that are disciplinary, or at least adjacent to what we consider to be disciplinary. TV Tropes is, fundamentally, infrastructure for a specific set of culturally-mediated conversations around analysis of media that mostly take place elsewhere on the web, most archetypally forums. Though TV Tropes hosts such discussions, and the articles themselves venture into interpretation more than, for example, Wikipedia, the primary purpose of the site is to provide structure and resources for a particular tradition of critical and analytical viewers, players, and readers, a group with its own specialized norms, methodology, and vocabulary. If this tradition is not a discipline, then it is at least adjacent to one.

Discipline, in the sense of an academic discipline, can be conceived in a number of ways. Social scientists such as Ken Hyland, using approaches such as discourse analysis, conceive of disciplines as professions that map to a network graph: "what academics do with words is to engage in a web of professional and social associations" citep:hyland_disciplinary_2013. While details of this form of analysis are of some interest—engineers "report" and biologists "describe;" venues and citation practices differ widely among disciplines—this approach treats disciplines and professions as essentially interchangeable, and ideas as little more than social glue. A radically different, though certainly not invalid, approach to disciplines is historical or etymological. In /Discipline and Punish/, Foucault lays out such a framework, tracing a broad concept of discipline to the emergence, from the 18th century onward, of specific modes of control exercised within military, medical and academic institutions. In the same historical vein, discipline and disciplines, again broadly conceived, can be further traced back to variably punitive medieval and early modern religious and scholastic traditions.

Though both approaches to discipline are apt enough[fn:unfortunately], in focusing on the forest (top-down institutional control) or trees (nodes in a professional network) they do not address differentiation among individual disciplines in critical areas such as subject of study or methodology. Armin Krishnan offers a list of criteria and characteristics of disciplines, defined as "structure for the organisation of learning and the systematic production of new knowledge":

[fn:unfortunately] Unfortunately.

#+END_QUOTE
Is "tropology," as the denizens of TV Tropes sometimes refer to their practices, a discipline? Quite likely not. Yet there are similarities and productive points of comparison. Tropology has a clear subject of study, one shared with a number of humanities disciplines. TV Tropes is evidence that tropology has a body of knowledge unique to the tradition. Tropers and fridge logicians[fn:fridge-logic] have their own specialized argot and practices, some of which have made it into the public consciousness. Troper concepts such as lampshading (pointing out an inconsistency before it rises to the attention of others) and gaslighting (denying or subtly altering another's perception of reality), among many others, emerged in fan analysis but have entered the public discourse. Tropers and fans have long recognized patterns, such as "Bury Your Gays," or the far disproportionate tendency for gay characters and especially couples to be killed off, and "Stuffed into the Fridge," or the gruesome murder of female characters for impact on a male character, and their specialist understanding and nomenclature has led to real awareness of, and action on, these issues. In terms of methodology, tropers deploy interpretive methods such as close reading. that are core to the academic humanities, and in general tropers display an awareness of specific fundamental concepts and approaches deployed in the academy, though they do not treat this knowledge as central in their own practices[fn:aware-of-us]. Perhaps most surprisingly, from a perspective within the academic humanities, is that tropers recognize their own form of critical distance. In the article "The Goals of TV Tropes," the community explicitly lays out a number of core values, one of which is "in order to be accessible, we cannot be locked into a specific fandom's viewpoint" citep:tv_tropes_tv_2020. Though this goal, as exercised within the community, has its own local meaning, it is fundamentally a call to adopt a specific mode of discourse across fields of interest and not to allow amateurism, or love of a work, to interfere with discourse and analysis.

[fn:aware-of-us] The TV Tropes community is frequently aware, at least in broad terms, of perspectives shared in disciplines such as Film Studies and English, and concepts such as authority and canonicity are held in common—see "Death of the Author" and "Canon," respectively citep:tv_tropes_tv_2020. There is a further awareness of a certain critical stance that is shared with academic humanists. From "Tv Tropes Will Ruin Your Life": "[a] common complaint of people who take courses like Media or Film studies is that they never look at a TV program, advertisement or film the same way ever again. ... Analyzing a medium in depth and pulling it apart by the seams teaches you to watch things critically. ... Most tropers, academics, directors or writers who do this start to find new ways to enjoy media. The subtle blends of plots, the new spins on old stories. The rare and welcome times where a plot you weren't expecting appears. But it is never the same" citep:tv_tropes_tv_2020. 
# Tropers and fan analysts seem, collectively, to be more aware of the academic humanities than the academic humanities is aware of fans and fan activity.


# !!! END FOOTNOTE

[fn:fridge-logic] Fridge logic describes a kind of armchair commentary that typically takes place shortly after the consumption of a work, as when a television viewer heads to the fridge for a snack after the credits roll. This can range from quibbles—"Why didn't they just put a brick on the accelerator?"—to relatively elaborate theorizing. Attentive writers can forestall fridge logic through the practice of lampshading, as explained above. If a character expresses surprise or confusion diagetically, the viewer understands that the writer is aware of the inconsistency.

We, as academic humanists, are not tropers, and "tropology" is not the academic humanities. Yet, in considering fan analysis as a proto-discipline, we can perhaps see that this effort is in many ways not so distant from our own. If we acknowledge the analogy between academic humanist and troper, the comparison becomes instructive for considering the state of our own values and infrastructure. From the ground up, TV Tropes is founded on a core set of clearly articulated principles:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
1. The wiki is about tropes used to tell stories.
2. We will be accessible and fun to read.
3. The wiki is for reaching the reader.
4. In order to be accessible, we cannot be locked into a specific fandom's viewpoint.
#+END_QUOTE
The first item outlines the disciplinary purpose: the subject matter, method, and level of analysis. From the outset, the site comprehends a tension between the disciplinary project and other forms of fan activity. This is not exclusary—the site hosts and tolerates other activity, but is not /about/ that activity. The other points relate to the core value of the site: accessibility. To be useful to the reader, to perform its role as infrastructure for a community of fan analysts, the site must be accessible to that community. The site itself, in conception, structure, and design, instantiates these values. Note the right-column side panel, visible on every page of the site:


#+CAPTION: The right column of each TV Tropes page, showing toggles and links that facilitate specific modes of reading.
#+NAME: tv_ tv-tropes-side-panel.png
#+ATTR_HTML: :alt The right column of each page on the TV Tropes website. The top portion shows four toggles that can be set to on or off: Show Spoilers, Night Vision, Sticky Header, Wide Load. Below are hyperlinks, including Ask The Tropers, Trope Finder, You Know That Show..., and Trope Launch Pad.
[[./images/tv-tropes-side-panel.png]]
# Screenshot taken on July 6rd, 2020
The toggles on the top right show an awareness of how the site is likely to be accessed and for what purpose: on a laptop or phone before bed (night vision), quickly browsing the site (sticky header), while consuming the media in question (show spoilers), or while reading longer analyses or discussions (wide load). The links below these toggles, such as "Ask the Tropers" and "Trope Finder," make the advice of the community available to those browsing, and are essentially prompts to engage directly with tropers. Organizationally, the site instantiates a negotiation between disciplinary (i.e., trope related) activity and more typical or freeform fan activity by affording access to sub-pages connected to specific tropes or works. For example, below the top heading on the "Ontological Mystery" trope page are four links: "Main," "Laconic," "Quotes," and a "Create New" option. The "Main" designation, active and highlighted on the "Ontological Mystery" article, designates a primary trope page, the name "Main" reinforcing the core value that "[t]he wiki is about tropes used to tell stories." The other links allow tropers to move sideways from this primary activity into areas away from the core values of the site, such as sharing quotes or creating elaborate fan theories (typically performed on pages designated "fridge"). When moving from the "Main" trope article for "Ontological Mystery" to the connected "Laconic" article, for example, we encounter a page hosting the shortest possible elucidation of the trope: "Where are we? And why?" Through these related or non-main pages, the site upholds its first value, recognizing that its primary concern is on tropes but nonetheless providing spaces for tropes to connect with a broader constellation of fan activity.

TV Tropes proves a powerful example of values instantiated as infrastructure. While this is not rare in itself, the adjacency, disciplinary and interpretive, of fan analysis communities to the academic humanities should give us pause. In the next section, we will briefly analyze a point of interaction between the public and the academic humanities, an article page in a proprietary scholarly database. We will consider this interface, not necessarily because it is core infrastructure for the humanities, but because it and similar pages are where members of the public are likely to find themselves when searching for, or attempting to share, scholarship in the humanities.[fn:brief]

[fn:brief] Our reading of this interface will be relatively brief, as I will assume more knowledge of scholarly databases than was warranted for an analysis of TV Tropes.

SAGE Journals, part of SAGE Publishing, hosts journals on the health sciences, life sciences, materials sciences, social sciences, and the humanities. According to an informational page for editors considering an agreement with SAGE, highlights of the journals program are a sales team "with excellent knowledge of library markets," a series of developing world initiatives for institutions in the global south that cannot afford high journal subscription costs, metrics and impact factor tracking, a social media network for journal promotion, an editorial workflow with resources for authors, and a for-charge gold open access program citep:sage_publishing_sage_2018. SAGE Journals is hosted on Literatum, a proprietary platform created by Atypon, now a subsidiary of publishing giant Wiley. In its marketing materials for Literatum, Atypon touts "[c]ontent recommendations and targeted ads ... powered by your visitors’ identities and site behavior—whether or not they are registered users" and its eCommerce functionality: "[e]asier to buy means easier to sell" citep:atypon_online_2020. The article page for "The Ethnography of Infrastructure", therefore, is representative of article pages across the 1000+ journals hosted by SAGE, and shares much in common with a larger set of articles hosted on the Literatum platform, other clients of which include Taylor & Francis and Elsevier.

Our article page for "The Ethnography of Infrastructure," as encountered by a non-academic member of the public, has a three-column layout on large devices. Above these columns, at the top of the page, is a navigation bar for SAGE Publishing, which gives options such as "Browse" and "Resources" that refer to the SAGE Journals platform, not the specific journal (in this case the /American Behavioral Scientist/). Below the navigation bar is a header consisting of the name and impact factor of the journal foregrounded on the journal's logo. With one exception, the ISSN or standard serial number in the footer, this is the only journal-specific "branding" on the page—that is, article pages on SAGE Journals tend to be largely uniform across journals.

In contrast to, for example, TV Tropes, this SAGE article page does not foreground the text of the article or its context in a larger disciplinary conversation. Rather, the central portion of the page, the place to which we have been conditioned to seek information, is dedicated to a section titled "Access Options." That section is divided into three subsections, "My Account," "Institutional Access," and "Purchase Content." On investigation, My Account," as an option, is less a path to access in itself than an alternate means to gain access through one's institution. To gain institutional access, one must be affiliated with a university that can afford the high subscription fees for the journal, or more likely a bundle of journals. Alternatively, one can purchase "24 hours online access to download content." For the article, the fee associated with this is $37.50, or $335.00 for the complete issue. It is here, likely, that our member of the public would conclude their search. Without institutional access or unusually deep pockets, our visitor is unlikely to further pursue this momentary curiosity in the humanities, and certainly will not be drawn into a vibrant online world of humanistic discourse.[fn:optimistic]

[fn:optimistic] Perhaps it may seem overly optimistic that humanities scholarship, if more readily available, could draw members of the public into an extended humanities community. From where we are now, the prospect does seem far off. But remember that lay hermaneutic communities, from the Sherlockian game to the lore movement to TV Tropes, achieve this. These groups draw members of the public from initial curiosity to learning to tentative participation to card-carrying membership, and their infrastructure facilitates movement from one level of participation to the next.


# !!!!! END FOOTENOTE

Though our curious member of the public has departed, let us spend a little more time with our SAGE Journals article page and further consider the values it instantiates. Just as TV Tropes makes sense given its unstated values—the site is about tropes, and will be accessible and fun to read—a SAGE Journals article page becomes highly legible when considered in light of the values and intentions motivating its construction. Taking a step back, let us postulate that a SAGE Journals article page is not designed to provide access, but rather leverage. We can actually derive SAGE's intended audience through information provided in the periphery of our article page. By clicking the "Need Help?" link under "Institutional Access," we find a relatively terse Help page that primarily serves to provide resources to a specific set of listed constituencies: "Librarians," "Authors," "Editors," "Reviewers," "Researchers," and "Societies." Fundamentally, the article page is designed for the consumption of the librarian—the customer. librarians, by and large, decide whether institutions will pay for specific "content," and the article page places specific forms of pressure on librarians. Researchers, encountering an article to which they do not have access, will frequently reach out to their institution's library, placing pressure on librarians to either purchase subscriptions or justify a choice to abstain. Authors, editors, and reviewers are necessary creators of the "content." Naturally, there is no designated constituency, or "Help," for community or public.

Worth highlighting here is how little use our article page for "The Ethnography of Infrastructure" is. Three sections of the page suggest some form of utility: the left sidebar, like the TV Tropes toggles, sports buttons for "Download PDF," "Cite," "Share," and "Request Permissions." The "Download PDF" button, predictably, does not download a PDF, but rather directs a visitor a few inches to the right to the central "Access Options" section. The "Cite" button is functional, if limited , allowing one to view a bibliography entry in one of four major citation formats and providing no explicit integration with citation managers like Zotero. The "Share" button provides a similarly limited interface to, for example, tweet about the article. The "Request Permissions" button directs one, somewhat alarmingly, to "Copyright Clearance Center's RightsLink service," where a visitor can employ a maximalist web form to, for example, ask to print copies of the article for a class. The right sidebar, after sharing limited information on the volume and issue in which the article appears, suggests similar and related articles, though all of the recommendations are also hosted on SAGE. A few other areas of the page, however, may actually prove useful to a researcher. These include the article's abstract and cited works, which appear below the central Access Options section, and the "Articles Citing This One" section, which provides links to works outside of SAGE Journals. These sections, however, appear to draw from Google Scholar, and do not appear to offer any functionality not already available on that platform.

** De Facto Infrastructure

Our SAGE Journals article page is disappointing as humanities infrastructure because it is not truly humanities infrastructure. That is, the proprietary databases that frequently host humanities research are not built by humanists, and thus it is unsurprising that they instantiate values not our own. At the core of the proprietary database as concept and infrastructure is not scholarship. The use of the word "content," rather than "writing," "thought," or "scholarship," in the implementation of these proprietary databases is telling. "Content," fundamentally, is the thing you put the ads around. While "content" is necessary, for the purposes of these platforms it is not an end but a means. The core of the proprietary database is not the dissemination of knowledge, but the furtherance of the /model/. These pages are not created to disseminate knowledge, but to derive benefit from friction generated when we reach for scholarship within our discipline. This dynamic, in which savvy strangers interpolate themselves between us and the disciplinary corpus, should be familiar to us. Just as Facebook sells us our friends and loved ones, commodifying the support of our community as "likes, the proprietary scholarly database sells us our own collective work as interchangeable "content."

Our work is transformed from living knowledge to grist for a profitable business model through our inattention, as humanists and academics , to infrastructure. In "The Humanistiscope: Exploring the Situatedness of Humanities Infrastructure," Patrick Svensson observes that "... when it comes to thinking about the humanities in terms of infrastructure, there seems to be a lack of both everyday systemic awareness and extensive critical work. Humanists do not thus necessarily think of what they do as situated and conditioned in terms of infrastructure" citep:svensson_humanistiscope_2015. Because we have not taken an active interest in the creation of infrastructure, we, as humanists, have become dependent on a set of /de facto/ infrastructures that instantiate values not our own. Our above reading of a SAGE Journals article pageprovides an example of infrastructure, created for us and not by us, that fails to reflect our values.

Humanists, of course, should not be creating their own water processing plants.[fn:tenure] However, our infrastructural choices have effects on the lives of our students, the shape of our research, and the nature of the university as an institution. In /Austerity Blues: Fighting for the Soul of Public Higher Education/, Michael Fabricant and Stephen Brier draw a line between infrastructural choices, including decisions made about platforms, and the politics of disinvestment that has negatively impacted higher education in the United States. In a moment in which tenured professors are being replaced by adjuncts, and in which the burden of tuition continues to be shifted onto our highest-need students, public institutions such as the City University of New York (CUNY) have spent disproportionate resources on infrastructural initiatives that primarily benefit large corporations. These include subscriptions to proprietary services such as Blackboard and exploitative partnerships with for-profit edtech initiatives such as MOOC2Degree. A notably pernicious example at the City University of New York is CUNYfirst, a highly expensive and low quality internal platform contracted out to Oracle:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
“CUNYfirst," an “enterprise resource planning" business software solution developed by Oracle’s PeopleSoft for CUNY to coordinate and “systematize" all university academic and administrative functions, will have a reported cost of more than $600 million in capital expenditure. That is not to mention the tens of thousands of unreported hours of CUNY staff time spent over the past decade of its implementation learning the complex procedures, time that could not be devoted to CUNY student and faculty needs. It is important to reiterate that this large cost has been incurred during a period of substantial student tuition increases and public-sector disinvestment. Equally important, CUNYfirst is an “off-the-shelf" system that has been plagued by many operating problems and obstacles, thus delaying its full implementation. [[citep:fabricant_austerity_2016][p. 96]]
#+END_QUOTE
CUNYfirst's expense and demonstrably poor performance stand out, but the true missed opportunity here is the contracted, corporate, and off-the-shelf nature of the platform. Paying Oracle $600,000,000 for /prix-fixe/ software is its own kind of disinvestment in public institutions. Imagine, instead, similar funding put toward building infrastructure tailored to the needs of the university, and that itself could be shared with other public institutions. Rather than a structure that instantiates the values of for-profit Oracle—CUNYfirst, for example, has a vestigial page where faculty can check their stock compensation—the platform could be built from the ground up for public higher education. The $600,000,000 sticker price for this uncustomized software could pay for a team of 200, compensated with a generous $200,000 in salary and benefits, to work for 15 years, and the presence of such a team would constitute its own kind of investment in infrastructural expertise at CUNY. More reasonably , this funding would likely go much further than simply building one platform toward a larger goal creating CUNY-specific infrastructure, investment that could help the university assume a leadership role and which would develop its independent ability to take on more ambitious infrastructural projects in the future.

This kind of speculation may seem ungrounded and unrelated to the humanities. However, ongoing work at CUNY has demonstrated the concrete benefits that arise from attention to and investment in local infrastructure, and humanists have been key to this current. Started by Matthew K. Gold, a professor of English at The Graduate Center, CUNY, the CUNY Academic Commons is a shared online space for CUNY students and faculty:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
... since its 2009 launch, CAC has garnered more than eight thousand CUNY faculty, staff, and graduate students who use its group sites, blogs, and wikis to find one another; to share information and ideas; to support and enhance the teaching of graduate-level courses ...; to collaborate on digital and other types of academic projects; and to form and sustain intellectual, political, cultural, and social communities. ... CAC has contributed immeasurably to building a sense of community and active intellectual engagement across the diverse and often fragmented multicampus CUNY system. And, in the spirit of the open-source idea, the CAC team has made the underlying software platform and computer code available for free to all potential users worldwide in its “Commons in a Box" program. [[citep:fabricant_austerity_2016][p. 217-218]]
#+END_QUOTE
The CUNY Academic Commons and similar initiatives such as Blogs at Baruch and Queens College's Qwriting are tailored to their environment in a way that the monolithic CUNYfirst is not. Perhaps more importantly, just as CUNYfirst represents a disinvestment in the public university as an institution, the CUNY Academic Commons represents an investment, and the second- and third-order effects of its creation have rippled out far beyond the institution. The most obvious effect of investment in the CUNY Academic Commons is that the platform, licensed as free software as part of the Commons in a Box project, has been adopted by a wide array of public institutions, from the MLA to state universities in California, Texas, and Florida. Boone Gorges, one of the original developers on the CUNY Academic Commons while a graduate student in philosophy, remarks on the decision to share the infrastructure more broadly: "[o]nce CUNY Commons was up, we got requests from all over the world asking us to tell them how to do the same. Commons in a Box is not only one-off software but a community project where people can come for support, share their work, and contribute ... . What I’ve seen anecdotally, people who otherwise could not set up a community site now can in half an hour. People who never could have done it before can create powerful online communities" citep:slavin_interview_2013. As part of CUNY Graduate Center Digital Initiatives, the CUNY Academic Commons and Commons in a Box projects have inspired other infrastructural efforts, such as the NEH-funded projects Social Paper, DH Box, and Beyond Citation, and the clustering together of these and other infrastructural initiatives has created an ecosystem of local expertise that particularly benefits graduate students. As humanists participate, and increasingly lead, in the building and maintenance of infrastructure, we not only allow ourselves to work in ways that exercise our values, but we clear the path, and create the knowledge, necessary for more ambitious work.

In other areas, humanists have answered /de facto/ infrastructure with humanities infrastructure and, perhaps to our own surprise, succeeded. In 2006, the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University released Zotero, a citation manager, and freely licensed software. At that time, the citation manager environment was dominated by RefWorks, proprietary software that is now owned and released by a ProQuest subsidiary. Since that time, Zotero has stood toe-to-toe with RefWorks and the similarly proprietary EndNote and Mendeley, and Mendeley even incorporates Zotero's open code into its citation processor and plugin for word processors.

Directly creating alternatives is not the only way to answer /de facto/ infrastructure. Lori Emerson, for example, in her work at the Media Archeology Lab at the University of Colorado, works to excavate possibilities of interface that have been closed off by the unrelenting ubiquity of tools such as Microsoft Word, "opening up how exactly interfaces limit and create certain creative possibilities" citep:emerson_reading_2014. In an interview with Jay Kirby, Emerson describes her methodology for allowing others to create distance from the cognitive and creative hegemony of Microsoft Word, software that is a /de facto/ standard for writing in the humanities:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
That is what I use the Media Archeology Lab for. I sit people down at, say, an Osborne I computer, and I invite them to use WordStar, which is entirely text-based and requires you to use about 90 different commands. Next, I ask them to read WordStar against Microsoft Word so that they can begin to actually see how other word processors have different or more capabilities than Word, and hopefully they begin to realize Word isn’t natural—it isn’t the only, or even the best, word processor. There are other ways you can process your documents and have very different, creative results. So to me, pedagogically, the best way to get students to think critically about interfaces is to read the past and the present against each other. citep:kirby_as_2016
#+END_QUOTE
Emerson creates and uses infrastructure—her Media Archeology Lab and its associated historical hardware and software—and studies infrastructure—in this case, Microsoft Word. Indispensable to this approach are core methods of the humanities, in this case critical interpretation and pedagogy. There is no tension between these approaches—infrastructural knowledge, the ability to see and think in terms of infrastructure, naturally extends Emerson's critical faculty. This work is humanities work, and the results, in /Reading Writing Interfaces/ and elsewhere, speak for themselves.

# Perhaps the strongest exemplar of lay hermaneutic infrastructure is the TV Tropes website, a wiki-style compendium of cultural and literary conventions in all forms of media. The site, comprehensive and deeply hypertextual, displays an irreverence born of early internet culture but also relative sophistication in its engagement of topics such as canonicity ("Canon," /TV Tropes/), authority ("Death of the Author," /TV Tropes/), and representation ("Bury Your Gays," /TV Tropes/; "Stuffed into the Fridge," /TV Tropes/). Notably, the TV Tropes community is frequently aware, at least in general terms, of perspectives shared in disciplines such as Film Studies and English ("TV Tropes Will Ruin Your Life", /TV Tropes/), though the obverse—knowledge within academic disciplines of lay perspectives and terminology—is not generally true. Though some interpretive work is shared on TV Tropes, the site is primarily intended as infrastructure—that is, to supply a shared vocabulary and implicit critical framework for discussion of creative works, most frequently in other communities online. Though TV Tropes, as a site, is privately owned, its ready availability, hypertextuality, and community engagement mean that it is an accessible resource for segments of the lay public drawn to hermaneutic practice but lacking the disciplinary training, rigorous though frequently out of reach, of the academy.

# From the perspective of an academic working in the humanities, it is difficult to take endeavors such as TV Tropes seriously. The website is almost too inviting, too public—clearly, the lack of a paywall, byzantine interface, or brutalist late-1990s design aesthetic belies the site's lack of seriousness. The site's name, now a misnomer given its transmedial ecumenism, suggests the TV that served as a cultural bugbear in the late 20th century, not the "peak" or "golden age" television that is a relatively sancioned subject of modern academic analysis. The absence of gatekeepers, the casual tenor of writing, and the embarrassing lack of distance—that is, the author collective's clear enjoyment—of their subjects of analysis only round out this dismal first impression. Yet the site, if we can bear to look at it, suggests an inditement of our inaccessible academic infrastructure in that it takes full advantage of the web as its medium and places no barriers, technological or professional, between itself and the reading public.

# Another manifestation of lay hermaneutics—outsider humanities—is the "lore" movement that has grown up around the analysis and interpretation of specific games, but which extends out to communities that form around fan works and born-digital writing. Increasingly, works such as the game /Dark Souls/ (2011) and the web comic and pop culture phenomenon /Homestuck/ (2009-2016) are created with the assumption that online communities will spring up around their explication, analysis, and interpretation. "Lore," in this context, refers to

** Tear Down This Wall

In the 1945 article "As We May Think," Vannevar Bush famously put forward the concept of the Memex, a kind of universal machinefor research and reading. Bush framed the need for such a device in what we would now regard as an argument for accessibility:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If the aggregate time spent in writing scholarly works and in reading them could be evaluated, the ratio between these amounts of time might well be startling. Those who conscientiously attempt to keep abreast of current thought, even in restricted fields, by close and continuous reading might well shy away from an examination calculated to show how much of the previous month's efforts could be produced on call. Mendel's concept of the laws of genetics was lost to the world for a generation because his publication did not reach the few who were capable of grasping and extending it; and this sort of catastrophe is undoubtedly being repeated all about us, as truly significant attainments become lost in the mass of the inconsequential.
#+END_QUOTE
Today, we have, in the form of the web and its associated infrastructure, surpassed the Memex—in every area—every area, that is, save for academic research. The world can gorge itself on knowledge, except that knowledge created by the one institution, the academy, notially concerned with its creation and dissemination. Though the sciences wrestle with the interposition of gatekeepers between themselves and their work, we in the humanities are explicitly concerned with values such as equity and justice. A complacency that keeps our work from academic humanists in less privileged institutions, from researchers with print and mobility disabilities, and from an interested public is unequal, and unjust. Further, while there is no guarantee that engagement with infrastructure, critically and practically, will reverse the ongoing crisis in the humanities, we cannot pretend to relevance while the only portal to our work lies in the hands of corporations with little interest in its dissemination.

This chapter, implicitly, has argued for an engagement with infrastructure. Other humanists, among them Alan Liu, Lori Emerson, Matt Gold, Patrick Svenson, Stephanie Boluk, Tara McPherson, and Tung-Hui Hu, have persuasively made this case, both explicitly and in their work on infrastructure. Infrastructure, however , should not be considered only as a new avenue of research in the humanities. It is also a necessary mode of negotiation, , a mode critical to preserving our autonomy, exercising our values, and sharing the work in our disciplinary tradition.

As we will explore in the conclusion to this project, there is a trend, a trajectory, a /wheft/ that encloses humanity, as conceived in the conventional sense but also in the sense of the humanistic. When considering the humanities and our negotiation within the larger collective, this manifests as a specific trajectory. The humanities faces an inability to effectively coordinate, a disspirited and underemployed cadre of junior scholars, and record low enrollment. It faces an array of savvy corporations buoyed on flows of capital, working tirelessly to grist "content" of our understanding and "value" of our values. We are no longer at the center of the university, and the university is no longer the center of culture. We may fail. We may already be failing.

Yet let us take heart. /There is no reason to hold back./ We have our methods and our values. We have our texts and our students. We read and think, speak and write. We are not lectureships, grants, or wood paneling. We have lost prestige, and need not fear the loss of prestige. We can change, and learn. 

For the same reasons the humanities is in decline, the humanities is needed. However, to persist, and eventually to resist, we must take what we can from other traditions while preserving that which is essential in our own. Those who do not share our values have built the world out from under us, and the platforms they have created only sell us back to ourselves. To seek autonomy, to negotiate, we must fully explore the boundary between the humanities and the encircling collective, and we must learn from other traditions. We are not the only flame.

In the next chapter, a conclusion to this project, I will gesture toward the unhuman, an imperfect term for a structure or entity with which the broadest collective—the universal, humanity, or /das Man/​—must contend. Just as the individual must negotiate with the immediate physical and social environment, and collectives such as the humanities must negotiate with the broader society, humanity—the universal—must negotiate with an environment of its—our—own creation. Part of the concern with this structure, this agaia, is that it can only be usefully described in its constituent parts and not in its totality, and so we will draw on the work of a variety of scholars who describe interlocking concerns at the edge of our collective comprehension. Perhaps more practically, we will also engage with the local, advocating for a /techne/ of autonomy in opposition to a technology—a Technology™—in service of dependence and inequity. As the humanities continues to engage with infrastructure, it is my hope that we will discover our own /techne/, an art that reflects our disciplinary methods, concerns, and values and preserves our autonomy.

# ** The Last Word

# Another instance of corporate infrastructure that has stolen, unexamined, into almost every corner of the humanities is Microsoft Word. Word is a /de facto/ standard in the humanities, widely used, and frequently required, for tasks as diverse as submitting a publication or conference proposal, crafting syllabuses, creating curriculum vitae, and turning in coursework. Unlike the difficulties surrounding capture of labor and restriction of research in scholarly publishing, however, use of proprietary tools such as Word is not widely or consistently criticized within the academy. Word is, to draw on Wallace's metaphor, the water in which we swim. Indeed, the application name, as envisioned by Microsoft marketer Rowland Hanson, was intended to evoke the embodiment of the word processor category, preempting even the thought of alternatives:

# #+BEGIN_QUOTE
# Hanson devised the approach to product branding that persists at Microsoft to this day. Each product’s name would be stripped down to its essence, creating the impression that it was the definitive—or the only—product of its type. The only ornamentation would be the Microsoft name, to make sure no one forgot who made it. ... [R]emembers Hanson, “... we wanted our name basically to define the generic." (Maher)
# #+END_QUOTE

# *************** TODO Hang a lampshade on the fact that it feels gauche to use hermaneutic methods on a tool
# *************** END

# Out of Microsoft's ubiquitous Office product line, three applications—Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Powerpoint, and Microsoft Word—are notable not only for their broad success—described in disquieting terms such as "mindshare" and "market penetration"—but for engendering a kind of rhetorical determinism. These Microsoft applications, used in every industry and walk of life, have not provoked resistance with the same level of organization as other infrastructural concerns such as exploitative and closed practices in academic publishing. This is, perhaps, because we possess the conceptual, cultural, and narratological framework for resisting corporations, but are only now developing the capacity to critically examine tools. Corporations are, at least for now, still composed of people, people whose motives can be called into question. Similarly, cultural works—published writing, film, even sales copy—appear to us transparently as the work of a motivated agent or agents, and can be examined either as the product of their author's intention or as a reflection of the cultural gestalt. The software application, however, is not widely regarded as a work, but as a mere tool. Bringing hermaneutic and critical analysis to bear on Microsoft Word, or any other program, still feels gauche, like penning a heated rebuttal to a shovel. Even a shovel has assumptions built into it, however—of its intended user's capabilities, morphology, and intention, at the least. Modern software applications, which can and do make many more assumptions and demands on our intention, attention, background, and cognition, should be examined as works of intent, not as artifacts independent of assumptions, purposes, and values.

# *************** TODO look of narratology to make sure i'm using the word right!
# *************** END

# This is not to say that there has not been critical analysis of tools or that there has been no resistance to Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, only that we are still at the beginning stages of developing critical vocabulary for an infrastructural critique, what Patrick Svenson has called an "infrastructural turn." Safiya Noble's /Algorithms of Oppression/, for example, has turned scrutiny toward Google, analysing how "results are ... normalized as believable and often presented as factual" (24). Under the rubric of Critical Infrastructure Studies, scholars such as Tara McPherson, Matthew K. Gold, Alan Liu, and Patrick Svenson have undertaken the foundational work of a hermaneutics of infrastructure, locating infrastructure's impact on the humanities and interdisciplinary communities of practice within the academy. This recent work, too, has been undergirded by work in platform studies, Critical Code Studies, New Media Studies, and media archeology by scholars such as Matthew Kirschenbaum, Lori Emerson, Ian Bogost, and Stephanie Boluk.

# Objections to Word, Excel, and PowerPoint have emerged from both within and without the academy, and have been premised on ethical, preservationist, aesthetic, cognitive, and practical arguments. One of the most tireless detractors of Microsoft PowerPoint has been Edward Tufte, a statistician, political scientist, and scholar of the visual display of information. In "The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint," Tufte argues that the omnipresent presentation application encourages—and in fact almost demands—shallow, procedural, hierarchical, ritualistic, and bureaucratic thinking:

# #+BEGIN_QUOTE
# PP convenience for the speaker can be costly to both content and audience. These costs result from the cognitive style characteristic of the standard default PP presentation: foreshortening of evidence and thought, low spatial resolution, a deeply hierarchical single-path structure as the model for organizing every type of content, breaking up narrative and data into slides and minimal fragments, rapid temporal sequencing of thin information rather than focused spatial analysis, conspicuous decoration and Phruff, a preoccupation with format not content, an attitude of commercialism that turns everything into a sales pitch. (2)
# #+END_QUOTE

# One of Tufte's principal objections to PowerPoint is that its limited information throughput requires presenters to condense ideas into slogans or cryptic fragments and that the ritual of creating a slide deck serves as a substitute for substance. Tufte offers as an example the mismanagement by NASA of the space shuttle Columbia disaster, citing a post-incident report that blamed PowerPoint for imprecision and signal distortion as information moved up the organizational hierarchy. By Tufte's reasoning, by providing the illusion that analysis had occured when it had not, and by replacing prose reports and other rhetorical constructs more reflective of genuine thought and consideration, PowerPoint presentations siloed knowledge, discouraged real discussion, and stifled the deep insights and distinctions that can only be shared through a paragraph of prose or, perhaps, a table of figures.

# #+CAPTION: A PowerPoint slide shown to Stanley McChrystal, the leader of American forces in Afghanistan. McChrystal is said to have quipped, “When we understand that slide, we’ll have won the war."

# Edward Tufte has been criticized for giving talks and lectures using a slideware style evocative of the PowerPoint patterns he has frequently and publicly denounced. While his apparent inability to shake the cognitive style of PowerPoint has called his observations into question, it also illustrates the insinuating nature of infrastructure, its capacity for shaping communication and consciousness. Software such as PowerPoint and Word, having existed so long without meaningful alternative, form an infrastructural ground, a set of expectations premised on pragmatism and rhetorical and conceptional familiarity. Just as it is difficult to step away from one's culture to see it from the outside, it is difficult to step away from infrastructure to observe how it shapes decision, action, and discourse.

# Within the humanities, practitioners in New Media studies are perhaps most attuned to the cognitive and rhetorical influence of the software and hardware that shape our intellectual labor. Lori Emerson, for example, in her work at the Media Archeology Lab at the University of Colorado, works to excavate possibilities of interface that have been closed off by the unrelenting ubiquity of tools such as Microsoft Word, "opening up how exactly interfaces limit and create certain creative possibilities" (Emerson ix). In an interview, Emerson describes her methodology for allowing others to create distance from the cognitive and creative hegemony of Microsoft Word:

# #+BEGIN_QUOTE

# ** who is building infrastructure?
# ** if we're doing infrastrcture, are we doing humanitie
# ** Reading Infrastructure: Critical Infrastructure Studies

# In recent years, groups of humanities practitioners have moved toward an increased awareness of the importance of infrastructure to areas of traditional concern to the humanities. Under the rubric of Critical Infrastructure Studies, scholars such as Alan Liu, Clare Birchall, Tara McPherson, Matthew K. Gold, and Lori Emerson have considered how infrastructure is implicated in inequality, XXX. Critical Infrastructure Studies combines an awareness of diverse but interrelated work in history (Thomas Hughes, Tom Standage), social sciences (Susan Leigh Star, Bruno Latour, Hannah Appel, Nikhil Anand Akhil Gupta), and national-level humanities computing (Sheila Anderson).

# Scholars working within this framework have already made a number of significant contributions. Alan Liu, in a draft for the book /Against the Cultural Singularity/, contends, startlingly but persuasively, that the study of infrastructure begins to approach the study of culture in furthering comprehension of modern social contexts. Lori Emerson, in writing and in pedagogy, interrogates assumptions about frictionless interfaces and the nature of the relationship between platform and user. Tara McPherson has offered views into how specific technological systems, including social networks and UNIX operating system architecture, can propagate racist ideology. Tung-Hui Hu, in /A Prehistory of the Cloud/, movingly traces the contiguity between new technocratic developments such as the cloud and historical and ongoing abuses of state power. These, and other, contributions to the nascent field of Critical Infrastructure Studies reveal technocratic ideologies both thinking and unthinking,, nested and interlocking systems of broad scope and deep complexity, and patterns of encoded exploitation and automated asymmetries of power. Collectively, this scholarship has moved the humanities toward a critical consciousness of infrastructure. Were we fish, we might be considered to have caught a glimpse of water.

# The focus of much of the scholarship that has inspired Critical Infrastructure Studies has been macroscopic—broad in scope and attempting to synthesize individual observations into an understanding of larger trends. In this chapter, I offer a view of infrastructure that is more mesoscopic—that is, attuned to the locus of interaction between an individual and community, or a community and its wider social and technological context. In outlining issues facing our community of practice in the humanities, I will necessarily discuss macroscopic trends, including adverse economics, the platformification of the academy, and barriers to unflinching public scholarship. In considering adaptations to these issues, however, I will advocate a hyperlocal view, one that arises out of immediate concerns within a community and which, even if adopted broadly across communities, remains responsive to individuated conditions and needs.

:notes:
 # More importantly, however, we encounter problems of recognition. In studying infrastructure, we contend with a set of questions. How can we talk about infrastructure? Is infrastructure worth discussing? And, if it is, should we in the humanities be the ones to do it?

# Infrastructure is complex. Not in the colloquial sense of "difficult to understand," though infrastructure is often that.

# Rather, it is complex in the sense of a whole comprised of multiple, frequently interdependent, parts. Because discussion of one facet of infrastructure frequently demands discussion of other facets, infrastructure is almost inherently difficult to address. Compounding this intractability is a problem of scale. In general, we—humanities scholars, academics more broadly, or people in general—perform poorly when considering the extremely large or the extremely small. Unfortunately, infrastructure is not a "meso-level" phenomenon. Infrastructure is the interstate highway system and the mineral balance of a drop of water. Infrastructure is levee maintenance in New Orleans and 220 billion lines of COBOL (Atwood). Infrastructure is this paper clip.
# #+CAPTION: A paperclip. Eat your heart out, Adam Smith
# #+NAME:   paperclip.jpg
# #+ATTR_HTML: :alt A boring image of a paperlcip.
# [[./images/paperclip.jpg]]

# Though scale, complexity, and interdependence pose a challenge to any discussion of infrastructure, to engaging the topic one must also wrestle with a second concern. David Foster Wallace puts his finger on this issue in his well-known graduation speech at Kenyon College:

# Because of its ubiquity, infrastructure is invisible. It is the inescapable medium in which we live and act. Infrastructure determines which actions are trivial, like drawing water from a tap. In its absence, as when transporting oneself around Fayetteville, North Carolina—America's least walkable city in 2017— without a car, infrastructure sets the bounds of the impossible. Despite, or perhaps because of, its importance, it is difficult to think about infrastructure unless maintaining that infrastructure is a specific component of our work or our identity—or, less desirably, when it fails us.. Typically, our interactions with infrastructure manifest themselves as abstractions of convenience. We think of the thousands of data centers, the hundreds of thousands of miles of cable, and the dozens of exabytes of data stored on connected devices as "the cloud." We ask few questions about where our water comes from, and even fewer about where it goes. We wonder about car internals only once our vehicle breaks down on the shoulder of a highway.

:end:

# A final concern with discussing infrastructure is that it is widely perceived as being value-neutral, inert to the considerations of equity, history, textuality, interpretation, and pedagogy that motivate scholars in the humanities.

** Two Futures and a Present

# Two futures, superimposed, haunt our present. 

Consuelo Ramos, the protagonist of the 1976 novel /Woman on the Edge of Time/, finds herself in a present on the verge of two futures. In the opening lines of the novel, we encounter a tension between the precarity of Connie's immediate situation and the presence of a link to something other:

Connie got up from her kitchen table and walked slowly to the door. Either I saw him or I didn’t and I’m crazy for real this time, she thought.

"It’s me—Dolly!" Her niece was screaming in the hall. "Let me in! Hurry!"

"Momentito." Connie fumbled with the bolt, the police lock, finally swinging the door wide. Dolly fell in past her, her face bloody. Connie clutched at Dolly, trying to see how badly she was hurt. "Qué pasa? Who did this?" cite:piercy_woman_1983

As we meet her in these opening lines, Connie is in a moment of crisis at the end of a long road punctuated by personal tragedy and grinding systemic injustice. Though talented, perceptive, and empathetic, she has been dragged under by a society that devalues and disempowers her and people like her. This first passage introduces an immediate crisis in the present: in the scene that follows, Connie, after attempting to defend her niece, is involuntarily committed to a mental hospital, beginning a process that will lead to a profound loss of personal autonomy and dignity. This passage, however, is not only about the present, but about a presence. Connie, living at a crucial point in history, is experiencing a connection with a potential future—"[e]ither I saw him or I didn’t and I’m crazy for real this time." The contrast between Connie's present and this potential future turns on autonomy. After Connie's involuntary incarceration, she grieves for the loss of control over herself and her environment:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
How she would celebrate her release! Her dingy two rooms with the toilet in the hall shone in her mind, vast and luxurious after the hospital. Doors she could shut! A toilet with a door! Chairs to sit in, a table of her own to eat on, a TV set that she could turn on and off and tune to whatever program she wanted to watch, her own bed with clean sheets and no stink of old piss. Her precious freedom and privacy! XXX
#+END_QUOTE
Throughout the novel, Connie is, by turns, physically injured, insulted, and ignored at the hands of authority figures—social workers, mental ward attendants, doctors, and police. Yet perhaps most galling for her is the denial of autonomy over her immediate physical and social space, a betrayal not only of a connection to a wider community but also the immediate and necessary circumstances of life.

As Connie is ground down in the present, first in poverty and later in incarceration, she also begins to forge a strange link to a potential future, one contrasting sharply with the circumstances in which she finds herself. These visitations from the future come in the form of encounters across time with Luciente, an occupant of the year 2137. Luciente's future is a radical culmination and extrapolation of the social movements of the 1960s and 1970s, including second-wave feminism, the women's health movement, early environmentalism, gay liberation, ecological anarchism, and civil rights, among others. When Connie, through her connection to Luciente, later visits the Mattapoisett of 2137, she finds a society that opposes social domination, traditional concepts of gender, and environmental expropriation. Along with attention to ecology, mental health, and personal growth, Luciente's society places particular emphasis on autonomy:

"Why do it that way?" Connie asked. "Some people know how to run a lab, and some people don’t, right?"

"Whenever we decide we’re ripe to join a work base, we fuse as full members. We share the exciting jobs and the dull jobs. We don’t think telling people what to do is a real world skill. ..." [[citep:piercy_woman_1983][p. 116]]
#+END_QUOTE

Throughout the novel, Luciente's future, in which systems of oppression based on gender, race, and cognition have been largely dismantled, provides a contrast with the injustice and humiliation experienced by Connie in the present. The Mattapoisett of 2137, however, is not the only future that Connie visits in the novel. Connie receives flashes of another eventuality, one in which oligarchs dominate humanity through rigid control and categorization: "Control of genetics. Technology of brain control. Birth-to-death surveillance. Chemical control through psychoactive drugs and neurotransmitters" [[citep:piercy_woman_1983][p. 216]]. In this future, Connie encounters Gildina, a woman who has undergone extensive surgery, including lightening her skin, to make herself more attractive to a hegemonic, and exclusively male, ruling caste. In this future, life outside controlled indoor spaces is intolerable due to environmental degredation, and practices such as cooking are unknown to Gildina and others in her position. For Gildina, there is only exploitation and entertainment—the situation into which she has been forced is without community, curiosity, purpose, or growth.

Each of these futures has seeds in Connie's present, and information from Luciente's future suggests that Connie is at a historical crux. This sense, that society and the world stand at the edge of two futures, resonates with the social movements of the era—there were, and are, no guarantees that rights won and change fought for could be retained and built upon in the decades to come. Connie's present, and her connection to two futures, also represent two radically divergent understandings of technology, and of how technology mediates the relationship between the local and the universal.

/Woman on the Edge of Time/, in its futures, does not depict technology as a binary, a simple agent for weal or for woe. Nor is technology some agnostic force, in the right hands a boon and in the wrong hands an ill. Technology, in broad form and writ large, is not itself a particularly useful concept in distinguishing between these futures. Consider Connie's confusion when introduced to Mattapoisett:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"More evolved!" Connie snorted. "I’d say things have gone backward!"

"Our technology did not develop in a straight line from yours," Luciente said seriously, looking with shining black gaze, merry, alert in a way that cast grace notes around her words. "We have limited resources. We plan cooperatively. We can afford to waste … nothing. You might say our—you’d say religion?—ideas make us see ourselves as partners with water, air, birds, fish, trees."

For Connie, the technology on display at Mattapoisett is something of a disappointment. Technology should be striking, imposing, rather than integrated into the existing context. For Connie, and for us, technology is associated with specific aesthetics—it should evoke awe, fear, or wonder. The aesthetic form most strongly associated with technology is the sublime, or the mode connected to confrontations with the vast, the new, or the ineffable: 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The sublime ... is an essentially religious feeling, aroused by the confrontation with impressive objects, such as Niagara Falls, the Grand Canyon, the New York skyline, the Golden Gate Bridge, or the earth­shaking launch of a space shuttle. ... [T]he emotion, although ineffable, is not inevitable. Over time, the same objects cannot always be counted upon to evoke the sublime response. Their power often decays, and other alternatives are sought. Ultimately, the constant is not the technological object per se; it is the continual redeployment of the sublime itself ... citep:nye_american_1996

When Connie first steps into Luciente's future, she envisions a world of dominating, thrusting structures: "[r]ocket ships, skyscrapers into the stratosphere, an underground mole world miles deep." Instead, the structures she does encounter are personal and broadly accessible, horizontal rather than vertical: "[a]rm in arm they strolled toward the meetinghouse, a building long and low like a loaf of bread" XXX. On arriving in this future, Connie is dismayed to see chickens and goats, an aesthetic of low agriculture rather than high technology. Luciente's response suggests a more deliberate approach to technology, one less concerned with grand visions and more concerned with deliberation and context: "'Connie, wait a little, trust a little. We have great belief in our ways. Let me show you … . No! Let our doing show itself. ... It has taken a long time to put the old good with the new good into a greater good'" XXX.

# Connie, here, falls into a common misunderstanding—that technology, aesthetically, should have ceremony  and apparatus, should impress the senses, should impose awe. Technology should be loud or slick, and in response we should be frightened or turned on.

 # Technology should break the context. The integrated technology of Mattapoisett is, for Connie, an aesthetic disapointment.

** Techne

Through these futures, Connie encounters two radically different interpretations of the phenomenon we call "technology." On the one hand, we have high technology, Technology™, or simply tech. This understanding positions technology as a force for social disruption, and so tech is associated with the new and the novel. On the other hand, we have what I will call here /techne/—technology that might also be called craft or art, that is personally accessible, and that blends into, rather than breaks, the context.

Discourse around technology tends to be almost painfully reductive, ossified into a set of hard aesthetic and historical distinctions. Even as the position of technology in society changes, the tenor of the discussion does not:

# In the 1999 /High Techne/, R. L. Rutsky observes how this dichotomy has locked technologists and anti-technologists into historically static conceptions of their own positions:

# In /High Techne/, XXX, drawing on Heidegger, observes that technology has become something of a cultural centerpiece,

Even when the debate concerns technological change, the terms of the debate do not seem to change at all: technology—or some aspect of it—is either celebrated or decried, cast as utopian or dystopian, in terms of its capacity either to serve "humanity” or to threaten it. The repetitiveness of these arguments results from the fact that they take the definition of technology for granted. For all the discussion of the implications of technological change, remarkably little attention has been devoted to possible changes in the conception of technology. [[citep:rutsky_high_1999][p. 2]]

/Technology/​—the word—no longer means what it once did. Increasingly, the term is used not to indicate the application of knowledge to real-world problems, but to describe a new form of mediated sociality. Concerns about, for example, "what happens when kids are perpetually exposed to technology" citep:detwiler_generation_2015, are not concerns that children are spending too much time looking through telescopes, hacking and making at their workbenches, or using their own spectroscopes to evaluate the effects of dissolved oxygen on marine ecosystems. Rather, /technology/, in this context, has a particular and narrow meaning: using a small set of specific, proprietary services on a small set of specific, proprietary devices. The term evokes first a set of interfaces, in particular smartphones and social media apps. Secondarily, it evokes a sector, the big 4.5 tech corporations that have come to dominate data and discourse in our society. Third, perhaps, might come a somewhat less narrow set of intensely hyped technologies—machine learning or cryptocurrency. Only after these associations—if then—might we consider more fundamental applications of knowledge: immunization, advances in solar energy, the Human Genome Project. Sherry Turkle employs this new usage of the word /technology/ in making a diagnosis of a sickness at the heart of our discourse:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Distracted at our dinner tables and living rooms, at our business meetings, and on our streets, we find traces of a new "silent spring"—a term Rachel Carson coined when we were ready to see that with technological change had come an assault on our environment. Now, we have arrived at another moment of recognition. This time, technology is implicated in an assault on empathy. citep:turkle_reclaiming_2016 XXX
#+END_QUOTE
When we use "technology" in the familiar way that Turkle does above, we refer not to the broad but to the narrow. This conception of technology, tech, feels less and less like something that belongs to society. Instead, it is something placed between us and the world, a secret flame held by a technocratic elite, a narrative of progress that fails to live up to its triumphalism.

Our strong association of technology with tech is profoundly limiting. Technology, fundamentally, is a shared knowledge of doing, yet we do not recognize a full range of knowledge and practice when we use the word "technology." Is close reading not technology? Is a family recipe not an algorithm? Is a support group not a platform? Is a personal library not infrastructure? Certain forms of technology are glorified, even fetishized, while essential ways of knowing and doing are systematically undervalued. A technology, ultimately, is knowledge put into practice. Why do we hold up technologies of control, technologies of corporations, governments, and the powerful, while eliding, downplaying, disparaging, or ignoring the technology of individuals and localities, small groups and "little" disciplines?


Techne[fn:techne-spelling] is a word from ancient Greek roughly translating to the knowledge of making and doing, or what we would call craft or art. Through its use in Homer, we learn that the term has its earliest origin in the craft of woodworking:

The literary tradition begins with the Homeric poems, in which “techne” has a variety of meanings. It names the "skill” of the shipbuilder who works with wood; the “craft” of Hephaestus, who forges metal bonds to hold even the mighty Ares; the "craftiness" of Proteus, who is able to change his form at will; and the "plan," or “stratagem,” Aegisthus devises to murder Agamemnon. In short, the meaning of the word in the Homeric poems is multifaceted. [[citep:roochnik_art_1996][p. 18]]
#+END_QUOTE
Words synchronous with the early Greek conception of techne might include craft, knack, practice, art, do, jutsu, or ken. These terms connote a practical instrumentality, cleverness or trickery, and the everyday products of manual work. The word "knack," for example, can refer to a specific or unusual manual skill, a clever trick, or a small craft item (as in "knick-knack"), and is connected to the knacker, the historically low-status profession focused on rendering horses into tallow.[fn:hacker-occult] Techne, traditionally, was associated primarily with the lower classes, and as deployed in Aristotle contrasts with episteme, or knowlege that is an end in itself:

[fn:hacker-occult] Conceptually, these terms are adjacent to the archetype of the modern hacker, who is concerned with making, tricks, and instrumental knowledge. Traditionally, some of these terms—craft, jutsu, art—are also connected to instrumental occult and magical practices.

For Aristotle, techne was a very particular kind of knowledge. It was not concerned with the necessary and eternal a priori truths of the cosmos, nor with the a posteriori contingencies and exigencies of ethics and politics. Rather, techne was instrumental reason, concerned with actualizing the potentialities of beings that had no capacity to do so on their own, and which could be otherwise. More- over, this was a kind of knowledge associated with people who were bound to necessity. That is, techne was chiefly operative in the domestic sphere ... . [[citep:young_bowing_2009][p. 191]]
#+END_QUOTE
Though in Plato techne is sometimes connected with the skills of the political classes, such as rhetoric and generalship, these applications tended to be comparative or dialectical—it is an open question whether rhetoric is techne, but sewing, ox handling, medicine, and cooking were obviously techne. In a real sense, techne was low and necessary knowledge, knowledge of survival and of living. Though there was an element of techne to the broader ethical, philosophical, and administrative concerns of the /polis/, techne was best understood as specific and instrumental knowledge for the maintenance and improvement of the immediate environment, practiced not by philosophers and rulers but by the lower classes.

This concept, techne, may help us to reframe our discourse around technology and "tech." Technology, as a term, likely deserves the negative connotations that have grown up around it. Tech has come to be associated with a discrete set of centralized and corporate projects with universal aspirations, such as to organize the world's information, sell any form of material good, or build an intermediating platform through which all human thought and communication are conducted. These projects, tech, are not technologies in the sense of those drawn from basic research that have so fundamentally altered life on earth over centuries, and which range from the quotidian (the barometer) to the miraculous (antibiotics) to the terrifying (nuclear weapons). While this conception of technology may be morally and practically ambiguous, neither are these technologies controlled by a single individual or organization. These fundamental technologies, though they may have extensive forseen and unforseen negative effects on humanity and the earth, cannot control and be controlled as can the modern tech platform. Further, the set of projects that define tech, in their broad scope and universal aims, cannot but violate our autonomy and trample local concerns and needs. To build an everything store, or to collect and control all human knowledge, is necessarily to call on /das Man/, and perhaps even to invoke something beyond, and even more inimical, than the human universal.

When we think of tech, we think of paradigms situated on the level of macro-scale entities and institutions—societies, nations, and corporations. This form of "technology" reaches, from on high, down into our lives. It offers us capabilities and connections, identity and convenience. It leverages iterative design, social science, and algorithm to nudge, rather than compel, recalcitrant humanity into engaging systems that control, flatten, and measure. We are grist in a highly abstract mill, our thoughts content, our relationships network effects, our differences market segments, and our common humanity an exploited vulnerability. Tech empowers, but only to the extent that we further render ourselves powerless.[fn:fish]

We begin to see, perhaps, that the word "technology" fails to serve us. We can, broadly and without fine distinctions, consider the term "technology" to refer to three separate phenomena. The first, scientific technology or "technology classic," describes applications of basic research, and is characterized by unpredictable second- and third-order effects and sweeping social changes. Technologies in this vein might include the steam engine, anesthesia, heavier-than-air flight, radio, birth control, computation, nuclear energy, antibiotics, and chemical fertilizers. These technologies, which shocked and shaped the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, can be associated with the aesthetic of the sublime in that they provoked awe and fear, the sense of the small in the presence of the surpassing and the ineffable. The second, tech, poses as scientific technology, self-consciously embracing the aesthetic of the technological sublime while delivering a calculated, rather than an uncontrolled, disruption. The essential difference between scientific technology and tech is in this retained control. Google is tech, and not technology, because any advances it represents do not escape its ambit. The horse may pull society, but its reins are firmly held. Prometheus has descended from the mountain, but we must beg for the light.

Culturally, we have come to expect, and perhaps to rely on, the unifying experiences provided by the technological sublime and the larger narrative of progress they uphold. Starting in the late 1990s, and with little fanfare, tech, rather than scientific technology, began to supply these cultural experiences. In the relative absence of major cultural disruptions or novums from scientific technology, tech has meted out a succession of upgrades and updates to platforms, providing conveniences that have grown into necessities and preserving the sense that society is moving forward technologically.[fn:technological-decline] By preserving a simulacra of technological progress, tech has presided over a reallocation of market power unprecedented in recent history, a transfer that has placed a small number of firms in a position to extract exorbitant rents, acquire or drive out competition, create new classes of contingent labor, and influence the political sphere. While scientific technology acted as a cultural wildcard, creating unpredictable second- and third-order effects, tech seeks to create a more predictable form of disruption in which power accrues to the firm and negatives, such as the decline of journalism or an increase in political polarization, are borne by the broader society and the public.

 
[fn:technological-decline] This point, that there has been little (scientific or fundamental) technological advancement in the 21st century may be surprising to some, though it is growing increasingly difficult to ignore. The slowdown is difficult to perceive partly because tech, or the platformification of society, has provided substantial cultural disruptions over the first two decades of the new century. As even the simulacrum of technological advance that has been provided by tech slows, however, the lack of significant new applications of basic research to day-to-day living is becoming more widely recognized.

A hard look at the scientific and technological advances developed over the first two decades of the twenty-first century reveals that they are immediately recognizable as incremental at best, and many or most can be associated with hype and potential rather than obvious or broad utility. One set—e-readers, home automation, online streaming—have disrupted specific industries and generated enormous value for a small number of corporations. Another set—3D printing, machine learning, gene editing, blockchain, augmented and virtual reality—have created fortunes based primarily on a perceived future potential that has largely not been actualized. Other technologies are useful, if incremental: a better artificial pancreas, e-cigarettes, tokenization for payment, new techniques for endoscopy.

The most immediately recognizable achievement, and perhaps the representative cultural symbol, of the twenty-first century, is, of course, the smartphone. The smartphone perhaps best represents the shift from scientific technology to tech, and probably alone accounts for the survival of a rhetoric of progress this far into the new century. Though it is suggestive of a fundamental advance, the smartphone as a piece of tech has been entirely controlled by two corporations, and has facilitated widespread platformification. It is a tool that transforms moments of reality—interactions between individuals, or with the built or natural environment—into engagements with a strictly controlled hyperreality. As an artifact, the smartphone is in no sense manipulable by its owner. It is unmodifiable and unrepairable. Though meaningful functional changes are rare, the smartphone must be frequently replaced, both for profit and to maintain an aura of steady technological progress. Unlike advances in scientific technology, the smartphone represents no new understanding that can be built upon, except, perhaps, for a new understanding of the malleability of humanity in the aggregate.

The question of why advances in scientific technology have slowed is a difficult one. It is possible that low-hanging fruit has been picked, though contemporary science is also underfunded and hyperspecialized. On the technological side, concentration in industry and rising inequality mean that measures of entrepreneurship such as the new startup rate have been declining for decades citep:haltiwanger_declining_2014,litan_whats_2014,fairliei_entrepreneurship_2020. At the same time, subsidies have disproportionately gone to applied, rather than basic, research citep:akcigit_back_2013 and maintaining steady progress in measurable fields such as transistor density has required an exponential increase in number of researchers citep:drezner_ideas_2017. In 2020, an Oxford geographer, Danny Dorling, released /Slowdown: The End of the Great Acceleration—and Why It’s Good for the Planet, the Economy, and Our Lives/, which among other claims supports the idea that basic science and technology are not performing as they did in the twentieth century. Though I beleive a slowdown in technology following from basic research is a reasonable conclusion, the discussion in the literature around a possible slowdown is at an early stage and the contention is yet controversial. nocite:dorling_slowdown:_2020

Tech has been the primary beneficiary of a confusion between scientific technology and tech. Semantic and cultural conflation in the modern usage of "technology" benefits tech in a number of ways. Tech has been given significant political leeway in part because the political sphere is hesitant to interfere with a narrative of progress. Because tech is positioned as an instantiation of technology, the political classes and society at large frequently turn toward tech when confronted with large or intractable problems.. Even if tech can provide no solution or only a minor mitigation, these corporations' rhetorical position as doers, the only set of institutions not in steep decline, makes them valuable partners. A little hope can carry a politician through a news cycle or election, and partnering with Google or Apple suggests initiative. Most importantly, tech's donning of the mantle of scientific technology obscures what these firms really are. Google is not seen as an advertising company, but a research outpost for AI, a provider of high-speed internet, and a pioneer of the smart city. Facebook is not seen as an advertising company, but a provider of free internet services to the Third World, a leader in chat interfaces, and a cryptocurrency innovator.[fn:fail]

[fn:fail] All of these initiatives, other than Google's AI research, have failed, either being discontinued or backburnered.

When most conceive of technology, the knowledge of doing, they think of scientific technology or, more recently, tech. However, people have been doing, and knowing how to do, long before scientific technology, and certainly long before tech. If scientific technology and tech are contenders for the cultural space occupied by technology, we should also consider techne, a modern craft of doing grounded in local understanding, as a potential contestant. Tech, fundamentally, functions to abstract people—users—from the world, forcing interactions through a platform. Tech creates distance and attenuation, a world viewed through an abstract filter in which our goals must first intersect the goals of the platform and those who control it. Not all ways of doing abstract in this way, however, and in fact most knowledge forges a stronger connection between us and the world. If I order coffee from Amazon, I am abstracted. If I make tea from a northern spice bush near my apartment, I am grounded. If I create a website on Squarespace, I give up control. If I serve some HTML files I wrote myself, I gain understanding. If we open Venmo, we view our community distantly. If we organize a susu[fn:susu], we connect with our community closely. If my university pays for Blackboard, Blackboard sits between me and my students. If we develop an alternative locally, we are bound together in our values.

[fn:susu] A susu is an informal savings club where participants pay in a set amount each month, and each month one member is given the collected proceeds. The term (and the concept) originated in West Africa and the Caribbean.

It is tempting to think of techne entirely as only a reconnection with the traditional, a rejection of inimical circumstances through a return to the past. To limit techne in this way, however, is to cede the future. Techne is the artist remixing traditional music on a Pocket Operator, the college student putting up her own website to sell homemade soap, the Pakistani hacker making a hearing aid from obsolete parts. These acts do an end run around extractive abstraction, drawing a line to the world that does not run through some grasping platform. Techne is technology of the local over the universal, autonomy over imposition, and continuity over disruption. Techne tends to create more than it extracts, to be gnarly rather than slick, to prefer the long game to the fast exit. Techne can be kind of janky—what humanity is there in perfection?

Techne and abstraction are not entirely incompatible. Technology that empowers others, that respects real difference, that encourages growth, or that cedes control to others can be techne, and can respect and encourage techne. Raspberry Pi, the $35 credit card-sized minicomputer, is, in a sense, a platform. However, the Pi, and the foundation that produces it, cede control: the device can be used for anything a small computer can be used for. In its mild jankiness, the Pi encourages real learning and growth.[fn:growth] In its lack of expense, the Pi makes possible projects and pedagogy that would otherwise be out of reach. In these qualities, the Pi, as a platform, builds, rather than exploits, community, and creates oxygen rather than sucking it from the room. There is nothing perfect about the Pi, but in its imperfection it is a thing of techne, and far from the slick affordances of tech.

[fn:growth] The learning comes as users try to answer questions, such as "What are all these little holes" "Is this thing on?" And "Which part is most likely to draw blood if I poke it the wrong way?" Learning can be painful. Really, though, the Pi is an amazing device, and I'm glad it exists, as both a machine and a community.

However, this form of modern techne, which cedes control while seeking to empower others, faces serious issues when confronting forces, including but not exclusively tech, that do not share its values. The seminal example of this dynamic in the twenty-first century has been the World Wide Web. Upon its inception in the early 1990s, this system of linked documents enabled a Cambrian explosion of individual and community creativity. The early web had a highly local feel—users, necessarily, actively moved from one page to another, rather than having information presented to them, and the early web had no practical facility for commercial transactions. The early web, fundamentally, was a thing of techne, enabling the sharing of handcrafted pages organized into local communities such as web rings. The web, however, was the precondition necessary for the rise of modern tech. In a 2018 interview, Tim Berners Lee expressed concern that the web had led to the emergence of something else, a superstructure based on centralized power that, fundamentally, stands against the interests of humanity:

The preconditions set by developments in scientific technology during the twentieth century, especially, but not exclusively, computation, have led to unprecedented forms of abstraction. Developments such as the web have encouraged novel forms and permutations of techne, including new modes of expression and art, widely available repositories of knowledge, and local communities that extend beyond geography. However, in parallel, tech and other centralizing forces have come to displace local autonomy and agency. Intermediating interfaces that flatten intent, algorithmically-curated streams, and the aggregation and analysis of personal data has allowed tech to bootstrap its way to a set of more traditional abuses: monopoly and monopsony[fn:monopsony], regulatory capture, aggressive acquisition of other firms, bundling or tying, blacklisting[fn:anti-competitive].

[fn:monopsony] A monopoly is an advantageous market condition in which there is only one seller. A monopsony is an advantageous market condition in which there is only one buyer., as when large firms agree not to "poach" employees, resulting in depressed wages.

[fn:anti-competitive] Bundling is the practice of forcing the use of one service by tying it to another. This practice is ubiquitous in tech, and examples range from Apple giving preferential treatment on its devices to its own services to the combination of most Google services into the same interface. Tech firms also use a form of blacklisting in which competitors or upstarts are removed or deranked in searches on a specific service, a favorite practice of Google and Amazon. Honestly, there are so many dirty tricks in this playbook that you could write a book just enumerating them and providing examples.

** Mankind Is Not Everybody

In /Erewhon; Or, Over the Range/, a 1872 utopian novel by Samuel Butler, the protagonist finds himself in the eponymous Erewhon, a hidden country invented to hold up a mirror to Victorian society. While Butler satirizes, among other targets, Britain's religion, penal system, and mental institutions, one three-chapter section of the novel stands apart. In Erewhon, machines of any sophistication or complexity have been outlawed following an arduous and costly civil war. The war, and the formation of the winning faction, the "anti-machinists," is precipitated by the publication of a book: /The Book of the Machines/. The three chapters represented as a transcription of the book opens with a question:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
There was a time, when the earth was to all appearance utterly destitute both of animal and vegetable life, and when according to the opinion of our best philosophers it was simply a hot round ball with a crust gradually cooling. Now if a human being had existed while the earth was in this state and had been allowed to see it as though it were some other world with which he had no concern, and if at the same time he were entirely ignorant of all physical science, would he not have pronounced it impossible that creatures possessed of anything like consciousness should be evolved from the seeming cinder which he was beholding? Would he not have denied that it contained any potentiality of consciousness? Yet in the course of time consciousness came. Is it not possible then that there may be even yet new channels dug out for consciousness, though we can detect no signs of them at present? (118)
#+END_QUOTE
/The Book of the Machines/ is remarkable in its departure from an anthropocentric, and even an animal-centered, understanding of consciousness. It chooses not to dwell on relatedness, or the mutual intelligibility of consanguinity, but considers consciousness as an emergent property that arises as a system works toward an end:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We find it difficult to sympathise with the emotions of a potato; so we do with those of an oyster. Neither of these things makes a noise on being boiled or opened, and noise appeals to us more strongly than anything else, because we make so much about our own sufferings. Since, then, they do not annoy us by any expression of pain we call them emotionless; and so quâ mankind they are; but mankind is not everybody.
#+END_QUOTE
Butler, considering the venus flytrap's ability to snap
 over its prey, asks: "Curious! that so unconscious a thing should have such a keen eye to its own interest. If this is unconsciousness, where is the use of consciousness?" Similarly, Butler observes that the common potato, stranded in a cellar, "has a certain low cunning about him which serves him in excellent stead," sending out shoots toward the light and, if encountering earth on the way, turning the discovery to its own ends.

Just as cells, acting in concert, comprise a system that works toward larger goals, Butler makes the argument that a combination of organic and inorganic, human and machine, might coalesce into a system of incredible breadth, one that might work toward its own ends. /The Book of the Machines/ was inspired by two fundamental observations. The first, drawing on Darwin's 1859 /Origin of Species/, is that emergent characteristics that serve an entity, that allow it to survive or thrive, are more likely to persist. The second, inspired by the development of networked technologies of transportation and communication such as the telegraph and the steam engine, is that the organic is not cleanly seperable from the inorganic, and that the inorganic is woven throughout entities we think of as exclusively organic.

This thesis—that an organism, or inorganism, can emerge from a concert of meat and machine—has since been taken up in many forms, some rejecting simple binaries such as consciousness and unconsciousness, organic and inorganic, and others attending to the rise of superstructures or self-perpetuating trends in which we are enmeshed. Donna Haraway's 1985"A Cyborg Manifesto" takes up the former thread, crafting a figure, the cyborg, that is a hybrid of machine and organism, lived reality and fiction, in order to take "pleasure in the confusion of boundaries" [[citep:haraway_manifestly_2016][p. 7]]:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 The last beachheads of uniqueness have been polluted ... Biology and evolutionary theory over the past two centuries have simultaneously produced modern organisms as objects of knowledge and reduced the line between humans and animals to a faint trace. ... ... The second leaky distinction is between animal–human (organism) and machine. ... [M]achines were not self-moving, self-designing, autonomous. They could not achieve man’s dream, only mock it. ... Late twentieth-century machines have made thoroughly ambiguous the difference between natural and artificial, mind and body, self-developing and externally designed, and many other distinctions that used to apply to organisms and machines. Our machines are disturbingly lively, and we ourselves frighteningly inert. [[citep:haraway_manifestly_2016][p. 11-12]]
#+END_QUOTE
Haraway's complication of the boundary between organic and inorganic aligns with Butler's critique of these distinctions: "" Who can draw the line? ... Is not everything interwoven with everything? Is not machinery linked with animal life in an infinite variety of ways? The shell of a hen’s egg ... is pure pottery." For Haraway, as for Butler, the breakdown of categories such as human and animal or organic and machine presages the emergence of a threatening new order. In Butler's case, this is machine supersession—that is, not our literal replacement by machines, but our incorporation into superstructures of human and machine, yoked to their conflicts and goals and thus subordinate in intent, meaning, and purpose. For Haraway, this meant the emergence of a new dynamic Haraway calls an "infomatics of domination." or an "integration/exploitation into a world system of production/reproduction and communication" [[citep:haraway_manifestly_2016][p. 32]].

The larger point here is that, fundamentally, in the absence of comfortable but porous categories such as organic and inorganic or conscious and unconscious, agency can be productively ascribed to a much wider variety of entities, systems, and phenomena. In an argument that biologists should not hesitate to ascribe intention to entities such as cells, organs, or jellyfish, Michael Levin and Daniel C Dennett make the case that cells are simultaneously individually agentic and part of a larger superstructure:


#+BEGIN_QUOTE
... individual cells are not just building blocks, like the basic parts of a ratchet or pump; they have extra competences that turn them into (unthinking) agents that, thanks to information they have on board, can assist in their own assembly into larger structures, and in other large-scale projects that they needn’t understand. citep:levin_cognition_2020
#+END_QUOTE
Cells have agency, in the clear sense that they have goals and the ability to act on those goals, often in sophisticated ways that require altered responses in reaction to changing circumstances. Thinking of them as agents, as possessed of intent and cognition, is not a fallacy of anthropomorphism, but a rejection of anthropocentrism. Further, considering systems such as cells to be agentic, to have goals and thus intent, is not simply a useful metaphor, but represents a better understanding. Levin and Dennett attempt to articulate this: "Now, we agree that attributing purpose to objects profligately is a mistake; Isaac Newton’s laws are great for predicting the path of a ball placed at the top of a hill, but they’re useless for understanding what a mouse at the top of a hill will do. So, the other way to make a mistake is to fail to attribute goal-directedness to a system that has it ... We reject a simplistic essentialism where humans have ‘real’ goals, and everything else has only metaphorical ‘as if’ goals" citep:levin_cognition_2020. The key insight here, perhaps, is not that we should exalt cells, or viruses, or any other entity or system that demonstrates agency. Rather, it is that we should step away from our own exaltation of ourselves as humans. By defetishizing our own unique consciousness and cognition, by ceasing to apply ourselves as a universal yardstick to every bug, cell, and blade of grass, we can better understand that we are not everybody, that there is thought, intent, and feeling that does not arise from, or depend on, the human mind.

** The Abstraction

The implications of this insight should disturb us, and not because humanity has an ingrained need to see itself as separate, special, and superior. Rather, it is in extrapolating this insight from smaller agentic systems—cells, mice, mitochondria, swarms, viruses—to larger ones, and specifically ones that may incorporate us. In some ways, ascribing agency in this direction is more intuitive. We are comfortable recognizing agency in organizations at many scales, from committees and corporations to nations and peoples, as long as humanity is considered the most important constituent. However, we tend not to ascribe agency to large systems in which the role of humanity is more peripheral.

Serious thought has gone into theorizing the nature of large, goal-directed systems and entities of which humanity is only one component. In addition, a wide variety of scholars and commentators have identified trends, phenomena, patterns, or entities that influence, envelop, or incorporate an unwilling humanity. While I will engage with a variety of theories about the nature of these systems and the disparate phenomena that support them, this treatment will not, and cannot, be comprehensive. Indeed, if there is a single notable feature of systems, phenomena, or entities at this level of abstraction, it is that they are incomprehensible, and beyond any unified or systematic understanding at the level of the individual. In this section, and for the remainder of this project, I will refer to this enclosing entity, the system at its broadest level of encirclement, as "the abstraction." This term is used partly to gesture to the inescapable reality that, while we can theorize such a system through study of its Nth-order effects[fn:nth], differences in scale, cognition, and goals render direct analysis difficult and discussion or dissemination of information a matter of practical impossibility. This theorized entity, the abstraction, poses the final challenge for negotiation: how do we contend with an encircling system so complex as to be incomprehensible? Further, how can we narrativize our resistance to an entity so vast as to resist depiction? 

[fn:nth] That is, the second-, third-, and fourth-level effects, and so on.


# END FOOTENOTE !!!

In a sense, the abstraction is the logical extension of, and mirror to, /das Man/, that universalizing identity that effaces difference by offering a broad and easily understood ideal. /Das Man/ is a story that sticks in the mind, a transmissible meme, an abstraction that stops at a point that is convenient in its narrative commensurability. The abstraction—the Abstraction—encircles more, claims more, than does /das Man/, and in doing so lurks outside our understanding. If /das Man/ is powerful—and dangerous, and limiting—by reducing to the level of the comprehensible, the power of the abstraction lies in an irreducible and inaccessible complexity. In this, it resembles the policy too convoluted, technical, or boring for the public to care about, but which has enormous downstream effects.[fn:boring-taxes].

[fn:boring-taxes] An example issue that, in its technical nature, is difficult to discuss in the public sphere, and yet has dramatic downstream effects on society, is the link in the United States between property taxes and school funding. The decision to have public schools funded by local property taxes leads to underfunded schools in low income areas, which in turn contributes to increased segregation and wealth and income inequality. The separation of the policy decision from its effects makes the connection apparent only, or at least primarily, to those with the greatest interest in its propagation. Another example might be proposals of a wealth tax compared to (mostly nonexistent) proposals for higher capital gains. A wealth tax is comprehensible to the public, and yet is less fearsome to the wealthy—money is largely only visible as it moves, and countries that have implemented a wealth tax have seen widespread evasion. When the public hears the term "capital gains," it begins to nod off. Despite the fact that implementing a progressive capital gains tax would cause the wealthy to sweat, its, for lack of a better word, boringness makes it a non-starter as a point around which to rally.

If the Abstraction is the largest self-directed process or entity that encloses all humanity, and if this enclosing entity is, almost by definition, too vast, entangled, or alien to be individually comprehended, an obvious question presents itself.[fn:two-questions] How can we narrativize, or even productively discuss, something that exceeds the bounds of comprehension, and resists useful forms of description? Here, one might appeal to feeling and intuition. That, perhaps, in fits and starts, in pockets and at the margins, in think pieces, in books, and at the dinner table, we grow aware that some totalizing force, some presence or trend or trend of trends, works against humanity. That scholars have described, in both sweeping visions and exhaustive detail, phenomena in which humankind is an unwilling participant, or of which it is a component, input, or symbiote.[fn:manifestations] That these describable and (relatively) verifiable processes are overlapping and interlinked, and that the whole is, at minimum, the sum of the parts. That our backs are a little more bent, and Moloch a touch closer to heaven.

My own colleague at the Graduate Center, Erin Glass, has described it, in the context of the academy, as the /invisible discipline/. XXX Though those who attempt to identify and define it each have a different sense of its shape, its scale, and its ends, there is a general sense that it is technocratic and technological—that is, comprising within itself systems of both humans and machines. There is also a sense that it is impersonal and encompassing—international or global in scope. (add megatechnics)


# !!!!! END FOOTNOTE

But this would be a retreat from the task. As Hobbes observes in, perhaps appropriately, /Leviathan/: "Fear of things invisible is the natural seed of that which every one ... calleth religion." And, fortunately, scholars in a wide variety of disciplines have engaged with humanity's situation in larger processes, whether geological, biological, or artificial. One such framework, frequently misunderstood, is the Gaia paradigm, originally put forth by environmentalist, scientist, and engineer James Lovelock. In a description of a meeting with Lovelock, Bruno Latour provides a summary of this hypothesis:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
At first glance there is nothing simpler than the Gaia hypothesis: living things do not reside in an environment, they fashion it. What we call the environment is the result of living things’ extensions; their successful inventions and apprenticeships. This is not proof that the Earth is “living,” but rather that everything we experience on Earth is the unforeseen, secondary, and involuntary effect of the action of living organisms. ... The first Gaia idea came about with the following line of reasoning: “If today’s humans, via their industries, can spread chemical products over the Earth that I can detect with my instruments, then it is certainly possible that all terrestrial biochemistry could also be the product of living beings. If humans can so radically modify their environment in so little time, then other beings could have done it as well over hundreds of millions of years.” Earth is well and truly an artificially conceived kind of technosphere for which living things are engineers as blind as termites. citep:latour_bruno_2018
#+END_QUOTE
Fundamentally, the Gaia hypothesis provides a template for an understanding of Earth as an artifact. The planet, with its familiar balance of gases in the atmosphere, salinity in seawater, soil composition, and maintenance of temperature and precipitation is conceived not as a progenitor, but in its current state as the end product of successive cycles of adaptation by organisms. Latour uses the example of "termite mounds and beaver dams, which are not living in themselves, but without living organisms there would be no mounds or dams" citep:latour_bruno_2018.

The implications of Gaia are many. First, that the Earth in its current form is not semi-permanent as historically conceived, but relatively fragile and influenced by changes in the behavior of organisms, as we have discovered in the age we now sometimes call the Anthropocene. Second, that entities or environments of which we are a part can be usefully conceived of as processes, subject to positive or negative feedback loops—that is, the environment can amplify or resist change, depending on the nature of the environment and the nature of the change. In other words, the environment is not passive in its construction by organisms—as we build something, something builds back. Finally, Gaia suggests that some conception of very large systems can be useful for understanding some local circumstances. While this is no guarantee that conceiving of the Abstraction, or the largest self-directed process of which humanity is a part, will lead to insight about local circumstances, it at least provides a model from which to work.

Gaia, the scientific theory, already encompasses the chemical exaust of humanity and our structures and machines—Lovelock, an inventor of high-precision instruments, originally formulated the theory by observing previously undetectable gas emanations from industry. In 1965, however, machines were not the stratum for cognition that they are in the third decade of the twenty-first century. If industry was, on Lovelock's electron capture detector, a factor in the composition of the planetary biosphere in 1965, cognition and computation affect the biosphere in ways that can be seen with the naked eye. To provide one, credulity-straining, example: a single paper of nine pages in length citep:nakamoto_bitcoin:_2008 has led to computation consuming about 1% of all power usage on the planet citep:bradbury_power_2020, a figure that, when compared to the power usage of nations, stands somewhere between the power use of Pakistan and the Netherlands. Another example, likely showing the beginning stages of a new trend, is the creation of machine learning model GPT3, trained on 199 billion tokens (a unit of data corresponding to approximately one word or semantically equivalent symbol) as inputs. According to a technical analysis of the training process by Lambda Labs, the "GPT-3 175B model required 3.14E23 FLOPS of computing for training. Even at theoretical 28 TFLOPS for V100 and lowest 3 year reserved cloud pricing, ... this will take 355 GPU-years and cost $4.6M for a single training run" citep:li_openais_2020. GPT3, widely considered a success due to its almost uncanny ability to perform well on tasks for which it has not explicitly been trained, validated the theory that a massive quantitative increase in inputs to a machine learning model could result in a qualitative difference in performance on tasks. Following this success, there is likely to be a boom in corporate and state investment in the training of massive models, and it is difficult to predict the scale of computation that might be undertaken in the coming decades.

Energy usage provides some sense of the size and scope of these new forms of human activity, and is also suggestive of the kinds of impact on the biosphere, due to release of gasses such as CO2, that are well described in the Gaia hypothesis and which inspired its articulation. However, they will not, perhaps, be in themselves the most significant consequences of the emerging global character of human computationally-enabled cognition.[fn:could-be] As computation, and computationally-enabled communication and cognition, become a, or the, central activity of humanity, as the infosphere increasingly influences and parasitizes the biosphere, as the global imposes on the local, we may find that the environment we are building develops emergent properties that are different and surprising.

[fn:could-be] Though they could be. The larger purpose of outlining these trends is to show the difficulty of negotiation in contexts where the global imposes on the local, and the ensuing loss of agency and narrative for individuals and small (or even large) groups. In this context, anything goes. Climate change is a tragic and monstrous process, and has already wrought damage to the biosphere that is painful to contemplate. It could, potentially, be the last and biggest challenge for humanity. Yet there are other dangers here, more difficult to collectively oppose or even discuss given that their nature resists narrative.


# !!!! END FOOTNOTE
Gaia, as a theory, was founded on insights from chemistry and engineering, and focuses on feedback between organisms and the biosphere we have collectively constructed. While it is not unreasonable to interpret Gaia as incorporating all human activity, and including our cognitive and computational processes, the theory, reasonably, focuses on our not insignificant chemical exhaust, considering these activities as an extension of industry. While Gaia, as a model of the biosphere, covers these processes, what if we were to more explicitly consider the infosphere, along with the biosphere, as part of Gaia? Alternatively, and reflecting on the rapid changes in the centrality, consolidation, and scale of the infosphere, what if we were to apply the basic framework of Gaia to our memetic ecology?

Let us call this Gaia, for the moment, Agaia, a refocusing of Gaia that is alternative, accelerated, and abstractitive[fn:abstractative][fn:gaia-name]. Gaia, in considering the Earth as an environment that is, in a real sense, constructed by organissms, suggests the fragility of that environment—that is, life can and does affect the biosphere. In the same way, memetic units, ideas[fn:inforgs], can directly affect the composition of the infosphere. Further, just as the meme, in its original formulation, was noted to propagate—and evolve—far faster than the gene [[citep:dawkins_selfish_1990][p. 189]], changes to the infosphere take place at a rate far faster than changes to the biosphere as posited under Gaia. In modern information ecosystems, cycles of feedback are incredibly tight, and, through abstraction, can make themselves tighter. For example, consider social media and the algorithms now used by platform owners to select and present specific information as part of a feed or stream. On the first and most basic level of abstraction, digital platforms, since the days of AOL and email, have allowed viral or otherwise "sticky" memes to propagate at speed through the facilitation of low-effort sharing across the network. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, however, platforms, most notably social media sites such as Facebook and link aggregators such as Reddit, found that detecting "sticky" content early and surfacing it rapidly to users could result in a quality of "stickiness"—really, addictiveness—adhering to the platform itself. Rather than logging into a platform and seeing an algorithmically simple content set—reverse chronological content as with blogs, email, or RSS, or a list of friends with whom to individually communicate, as with early messengers—the user is presented with a set of content chosen for its virality or its potential to engage or convert[fn:convert]. This form of algorithmically-generated feed is more advantageous to the platform owner for a number of reasons. First, the nature of content in the feed becomes that of constant, if artificial, interest. While a feed of news, as in a newspaper, might consist of some stories that are, subjectively, of interest and some that are, subjectively, boring, everything you see in your feed is pitched to strike a nerve, whether to make you feel comfortable and affiliated, to provoke righteous anger, to elicit laughter or tears, or to cause fear and uncertainty. Second, not knowing what will surface next in the feed generates an environment of variable reward, which, as with slot machines, has a more addictive quality than predictable rewards. Perhaps most insidiously, however, modern algorithmic feeds allow for feedback to work both ways—that is, they allow for experiments to be performed on users and, more commonly, user segments. This, in turn, leads, and has led, to the next level of abstraction, and the further tightening of positive and negative feedback loops within the ecosystem of the feed. At this level, time spent on the platform not only provides feedback about what information is sticky and what is not, but furnishes platform owners with the data needed to further train and tune the algorithm. At this level, algorithms become so finely tuned to specific populations, and segmentation becomes so rapid, that a highly personalized, and even by modern standards highly addictive, feed can be generated after as few as four or five platform engagements. Thus far, this stage has bee manifest in its most elemental form by short video platform TikTok.

[fn:gaia-name] Obviously, using the term Agaia is most suggestive of a model that is anti-Gaia. I think this is appropriate, especially given the history and valences of the name Gaia as used in the Gaia hypothesis. There is a bit of an odd relationship between the model presented in the theory and the name Lovelock used to label it. On initial inspection, "Gaia" is appropriate enough to identify the theory, given that it is a hypothesis about the whole Earth. However, to the layperson, the term strongly evokes the idea that the Earth is not merely a (somewhat) unified and constructed environment, but that it is, itself, a life. The first symposium on Gaia as a hypothesis was entitled "Is the Earth a Living Organism?" Even within the scientific community, there was controversy centered on the imprecise articulation of the theory. Biogeochemist James Kirchner criticized the theory as actually proposing multiple hypotheses ranging from the self-evident to the "highly speculative" citep:kirchner_gaia_1989. Many of the discussions around Gaia centered around movement between a weak version of the Gaia theory, which was limited in its articulation and fairly uncontroversial, and a strong version, in which the Earth is a teleological system, meaning that it, to some greater or lesser extent, works toward the maintenance of life on the planet. The highly metaphorical naming of the Gaia theory likely contributed to its broader dissemination, and even today it is frequently mischaracterized or overstated by those who have a more transcendent view of the Earth as a living entity.

It seems appropriate to describe an Agaia focused on an infosphere that is, in many ways, antithetical to the biosphere, even if my main articulation of the concept isn't centered on this antithesis. This feels symmetrical to the relationship between Gaia as theory and Gaia as metaphor.

The capability of entities operating within the infosphere to go up one level of abstraction, recursively using tight feedback loops to further tighten feedback loops, creates an information ecosystem that is not simply fast, but accelerating. On the first level, an algorithm optimizes the presentation of content in order to maximize some metric of use to the platform owner, such as engagement (Twitter and Facebook) or watch time (post-2012 YouTube). While this is highly lucrative in itself, moving up another level of abstraction provides far greater rewards. By optimizing not only for engagement, but for learning how to increase engagement, platforms place a virtuous circle within a virtuous circle, not just tightening algorithms, but tightening algorithm-tightening algorithms. At this level, it is not simply market power and network effects that contribute to the success of the platform, but the model. The term "model," as used in the bench sciences and quantitative social sciences, but most relevantly computer science, is a constructed, predictive abstraction. In a somewhat trivial sense, the common map is a model. A map is a reduction created for the purpose of prediction. Maps are untrue in the sense that they necessarily leave out more than they keep. And yet maps are demonstrably useful, most especially when created for a specific purpose. Models are concrete abstractions, instantiations of a set of insights an inch across and a mile deep. They are, like a function, map or key, a transformative element. Given X and Y, predict Z. Given Z and M, predict how to better predict Z. Given Z, M, and P, refine P. While the model instantiates or crystallizes knowledge in a domain, allowing for increased accuracy of prediction within that narrow sphere, the training of the model also tends to result in insights about how to further refine models.

Agaia, then, as a view of specific processes within the global infosphere, is characterized by acceleration. This is not, however, The Acceleration, or the Singularity predicted in books such as Ray Kurzweil's /The Age of Spiritual Machines/—that is, a broad and accelerating technological capability to broadly accelerate technological capability, or, put another way, intelligence sufficient to increase intelligence. As previously discussed, if anything, application of developments in basic science to day-to-day life has slowed, at least in most fields. Rather, these hybrid legacy corporate and technological systems are like enormous flywheels: spinning freely and without traction, they have little effect, but anything coming into direct contact is rapidly transformed or obliterated. 

 # These interventions, disruptions from above, can rapidly undermine or destroy institutions, start or end cultural movements, bestow or strip fortunes. The general effect is one of hurry up and wait. We experience a stultifying lack of progress, broken only by the disorienting destruction of some longstanding feature of the social fabric or the transient amusement to be had at the curdling of an anthem into a jingle.

 To put this another way, Agaia is less a general process for working toward a general intelligence[fn:agi], but a general process for working toward highly specific intelligences. At the highest level of abstraction, it is the global capability of the infosphere to increase its ability to model and disrupt specific economic, cultural, cognitive, or social domains. On the ground, we do not see a global transformation. Rather, we see what appear to be random acts of post modernity, whether the quick destruction and replacement of an industry, the hallowing out of a hallowed institution, or the undermining of some foundational or unifying narrative. 


[fn:agi] Used here in the sense of Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI, arguably the holy grail or philosopher's stone of computational research.

# ** Story Death

So far, we have considered a few potential approaches to the Abstraction, the universal at the greatest potential remove from the local, or the most remote enclosure or system within which we are contained. The first approach, admittedly something of a cheat, appealed to instinct, the suspicion that some force impedes or resists the better efforts of humanity along many critical dimensions. The second aggregated the diagnoses of major maladies and dysfunctions at the juncture of culture and technology and suggested that these phenomena must necessarily be interconnected. The third offered the dark reflection of an ecological theory and metaphor, Gaia, extrapolated to the modern infosphere and outlining the possibility of an environment, constructed by organisms, that is in some sense self-regulating or otherwise agentic.[fn:teleology]

[fn:teleology] In our nightmares this would parallel the "strong" theory of Gaia, being then a system with a goal, end state, or teleology.


# !!!! END FOOTENOTE

We have had to approach the Abstraction indirectly, rather than simply pointing to it. The Abstraction is, almost by definition, inaccessible to direct analysis, at least by some one individual. We have our suspicions as to its nature—complex, interconnected, a hybrid of organic life and machine, and potentially inimical to the values of some or many of the entities it encloses. Due to its scale and complexity, there is an odd disconnection between the entity or metaprocess of the Abstraction and its effects as felt in the local. Conceptually, intellectually, we can only grasp so much, and our own personal abstractions can only reach so high. We might digest some of the complexities of a specific state, or of geopolitics, or of transistor technology, or of the local economics affecting a stone quarry, or of the migratory patterns of Monarch butterflies, or of the biology of a species of moss. We might also grasp how some of these individual complexities overlap and interconnect. At some point, however, and likely sooner rather than later, understanding fails. Processes, or a collective metaprocess, that operate beyond this threshold resist comprehension. Further, even if this veil can be pierced to some extent, any insights may prove largely incommunicable.

To put this more baldly, the Abstraction kills story. To qualify this slightly, it kills /useful/ story, narrative around which coalitions can be built or through which specific challenges can be identified and addressed. This does not mean that narrative cannot or will not continue to be situationally useful. There will continue to be demagogues and idealists, foxes and hedgehogs[fn:berlin], wonks and saints. The narratives wielded by these individuals, and the groups they support and represent, will still work for weal or for woe, and will address, well or poorly, issues present in the world. Narrative will continue to be the sea of ideas in which we bathe. However, a space, large an increasing in size, exists outside the reach of our collective narrative capability. The introduction of mechanism, most notably computation, to many or most social dynamics, and the interconnected and global nature of a wide variety of systems, mean that affected individuals, and the public, can only dimly apprehend the inimical processes of which they—we—are both victim and component. We cannot fight without a cause, or strive without story. And our stories fail against the complexity of the Abstraction.

** Reaching Forward



At the conclusion of /Woman on the Edge of Time/, Connie, backed into a corner, faces a dark and damning choice. In the institution in which she is incarcerated, Connie becomes the subject of an experiment, and is implanted with a device designed to make her more docile, a better fit for society's expectations. After this operation, her receptivity to potential futures, which has allowed her to touch Luciente's time, directs her to other, more frightening alternatives. Among these are the front lines of a war in which Luciente is a soldier, a war in which per[fn:pers] side is losing ground. Connie senses that the bright future, Luciente's original future, is slipping away due to circumstances in her present, and in particular the development of the controlling technology now implanted in her body. In response, she formulates a dark and consequential resolution. The night before she puts her plan into effect, Connie fights to reconnect with Luciente's bright future for a final conversation.

[fn:pers] Luciente's future uses the gender-neutral pronoun "pers."

“I blather.” Luciente drew Connie away. “Such hardness in your mind tonight makes me babble more than usual. I fear for you.” ... Lazy flakes drifted onto the arm of the borrowed jacket. "Luciente, do you think it’s always wrong to kill?" ... “How can I face something so abstract?”
#+END_QUOTE
Connie has been backed into a corner. To defend her mind, to defend the future she has come to love, she contemplates a violation of her own principles, a compromise that will strip her of the little flame that she has carried with her through hardship and that has allowed her to see across centuries. Piercy holds little back in the final paragraphs of the text.

She washed her hands in the bathroom, she washed them again and again. ... I killed them. Because it is war.” Her hands shook like a willow branch used by dowsers in Texas, a willow branch pulled by water deep in the ground. “I’m a dead woman now too. I know it. But I did fight them. I’m not ashamed. I tried.” ... She thought of Luciente, but she could no longer reach over. She could no longer catch. She had annealed her mind and she was not a receptive woman. She had hardened. But she thought of Mattapoisett.
#+END_QUOTE
The response elicited by Piercy at the end of this novel is not celebration at a strike against iniquity, but the kind of sickness felt in the stomach at the contemplation of deep wrong. Connie, and we, are not allowed to know whether this terrible act has preserved Luciente's Mattapoisett. Yet in the confrontation of this vast and unknown future, and possibly also in the resistance to oppressive consensus, there is hope.

In "A Ten-Day Voyage," a chapter in R.D. Laing's 1967 /The Politics of Experience/, the author transcribes the account of an individual, a sailor, who breaks with reality, and who, perhaps more notably, returns.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I wasn’t just living on the – the moving moment, the present, but I was moving and living in a – in another time dimension added to the time situation in which I am now. ... I feel that it was not senseless – although I suppose to others about me I was – er – mad in as much as I was not living in this present time, and if I was not living in this present time I was therefore incapable of coping with it properly. But I had this feeling all the time of – er – moving back – even backwards and forwards in time, that I was not just living in the present moment. And I could much more easily go back than I could go forward because the forward movement was a bit too much for me to take.' citep:laing_politics_1970
#+END_QUOTE
In the ontology encountered during this ten-day experience, we, beings, grow in understanding as we move forward. Though the traveler, unstuck in time, can move forward to encounter or glimpse a greater state of understanding and comprehension, such encounters must be brief. We are not yet enough. "[T]he journey is there and every single one of us has got to go through it, and – um – everything – you can’t dodge it. the purpose of everything and the whole of existence is – er – to equip you to take another step, and another step, and another step, and so on" citep:laing_politics_1970.

For Laing, the experience of the traveler embodies a specific idea about the nature of the relationship between the individual and society. The society, in its system, imposes a consensus reality. To operate within this consensus defines sanity. To step outside this imposed context into a broader context, or a context that rejects or disregards barriers and constraints, is to venture into a realm that society calls "madness: " The traveller "trusted his experience of having entered into a state of more, not less, reality, of hyper-sanity, not sub-sanity" citep:laing_politics_1970.

In the previous section, we considered the potential existence of an Abstraction, an entity or contiguous system at the furthest remove from the individual or small group. Fundamentally, the challenge posed by the Abstraction is one of negotiation. It is challenging enough to encounter, and contend with, adverse circumstances in the immediate built environment (Chapter Two), collective narrative (Chapter Three), or larger organizations and structures (Chapter Four). At the broadest level of encirclement, however, we are imposed on from a great remove. At this scale, distance, and complexity, understanding the nature of the environment and its influence on us becomes less a matter of reading than a matter of sensing. We cannot, as limited and contingent beings, know the full nature of the system in which we find ourselves. Despite this, we must choose our stance, whether one of hope or despair, and determine how we will negotiate, whether merely to survive or to, perhaps quixotically, effect change.

IN her final exigency, with her back against the wall, Connie chooses to kill, to destroy life, in the defense of a future and in defiance of a present. I cannot say, at least with any certainty, that such choices are wrong. Sometimes, and perhaps even often, systems, and their component beings and things, must be opposed, and opposed with every bit of power and control that can be laid hands on. Sometimes, choices are not so much made as forced. Yet, it may be, that in seizing any power, in exerting any available control to steer the world toward the bright future, we find that the brightness dims, and the future recedes. Those building the Abstraction, or who spread their wings to catch a tailwind from above, also steer the world toward their own imagined utopias. In seizing power, it is difficult not to replicate the systems that justified the seizing of power. In jailing the jailers, we build prisons. In killing, we become killers.[fn:caveat]

[fn:caveat] I am sure it is the case that some systems are beyond redemption. But this may also be true less often than we wish to think.

These are broad thoughts necessarily applied in local circumstances. As with all abstractions, much is lost.

It is my utmost hope that your back is not yet against the wall, and that you are in the privileged position to have some little latitude, that you can survive, or strive, on something resembling your own terms.[fn:give-hell] If this is the case, then the following thoughts, the last in this project, consider approaches and stances toward negotiating the Abstraction. They are rooted in the exercise of autonomy and, specifically, the use of local knowledge and action yet with the hope or aspiration to effect larger change.

To resist, engage, or even conceptualize something as overwhelming as our theorized Abstraction requires a specific cast of mind. In /The Principle of Hope/, Ernst Bloch observes that we are all in a process of continuous becoming, that "much in the world is still unclosed."

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
No thing could be altered in accordance with wishes if the world were closed, full of fixed, even perfected facts. Instead of these there are simply processes, i.e. dynamic relation- ships in which the Become has not completely triumphed. The Real is process; the latter is the widely ramified mediation between present, unfinished past, and above all: possible future. Indeed, everything real passes over into the Possible at its processual Front, and possible is everything that is only partially conditioned, that has not yet been fully or conclusively determined. [[citep:bloch_principle_1995-1][p. 196]]
#+END_QUOTE
To see the system and to step outside it in the imagination is, as suggested by Laing's account of the traveler to the past and future, a form of madness. To envision ways to carve out a space for ourselves or for our community, we must be mad enough to leave consensus reality, but also mad enough to come back. After touching the universal, or glimpsing a future, we must step back to the local as our site of action and change.

As we explored in Chapter Two, the idealized figure of the hacker also affects changes in larger systems through application of deep local knowledge. The hacker leverages her own hyperlocal understanding—the obscure bug, the misconfigured server, the unanticipated input—to identify a weakness in a dynamic system. From there, the hacker can choose to repair and maintain through propagation of local knowledge upward, following the paradigm of the white hat. Alternatively, donning the black hat, the hacker can "escalate" to undermine, coopt, or otherwise subvert the system. We have theorized the Abstraction as a system, and all systems have weaknesses. Some of this hacking might be technical—the "mispurposing" of a commercial application[fn:mispurposing], the clever repair of the community coffee maker, the exfiltration of data to enable the blowing of a whistle. More critical, however, will be the broader application of the hacker sensibility to enable the carving out of spaces of resistance. We all understand our family, our block, our neighborhood, and our community better than does the Abstraction. The squatter, the union organizer, the herbalist: they, too, know when to sow and when to reap, can spot the crack in the sidewalk or the whispered conversation and gauge the time to act. Only structures with scale can be seen from a great height. Do the things that cannot scale in the small spaces the Abstraction cannot see.

[fn:mispurposing] No day in which you violate a commercial Terms of Service agreement is a day wasted.

One might ask, then, how one might scale the unscalable. How can the Abstraction be undermined without replacing it with a system more total in its size and apparatus? How can a rigid and carefully tended garden cultivated by the Abstraction be replaced by anything other than something equally artificial, equally rigid? Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing provides an approach to resistant unscalability via the metaphor of the matsutake forest:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Contrast the matsutake forest: unlike sugarcane clones, matsutake make it evident that they cannot live without transformative relations with other species. Matsutake mushrooms are the fruiting bodies of an underground fungus associated with certain forest trees. The fungus gets its carbohydrates from mutualistic relations with the roots of its host trees, for whom it also forages. Matsutake make it possible for host trees to live in poor soils, without fertile humus. In turn, they are nourished by the trees. This transformative mutualism has made it impossible for humans to cultivate matsutake. ... Matsutake resist the conditions of the plantation. [[citep:tsing_mushroom_2015][p. 40]]
#+END_QUOTE
Tsing offers a contrast between the plantation, emblematic of rigid homogeneity, exploitative relationships, and oppressive design, and the matsutake forest, in which complex interrelationships facilitate growth and creation that does not survive abstraction to scale. These mushrooms grow only in uncultivated places. To the extent that commercial forces wish to extract these mushrooms as resources, they must preserve intact the web of local relationships that make their existence possible. This kind of mutuality, therefore, makes it more costly to exploit or destroy the local by rendering it legible to the universal.

While preserving existing interdependent local complexity is crucial, it is also possible to cultivate uncultivated spaces. Cider brewer[fn:brewing] and orchardist Andy Brennan has developed a philosophy around the cultivation of feral orchards, or orchards that were once cultivated that have reasserted themselves as autonomous.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I’m very uneasy about pinning my hopes on anything connected to a financial economy dependent on growth. After all, some things cannot be scaled up. ... Love, wonder, true art, inspiration—all these things are about the intimacy of direct relationships; they exist in unscalable worlds, and it’s in those worlds that wild apples have their highest value. So I’m hoping to keep wild apple trees and artisan cider independent of the pressures of conformity. ... To belabor this point: Independence is the most important thing I could cultivate (or uncultivate) in the forchard [feral orchard] [[citep:brennan_uncultivated:_2019][p. 163]]
#+END_QUOTE
There is a tragedy to mass cultivation of apples. Apples are the most sprayed crop, and in cultivated orchards they stand, cloned, grafted to alien rootstock for survival. In the wild, or in a feral orchard, however, they are transformed into hardy and long-lived trees. Apple trees are naturally social, and do best at the edges of forests and in other locations where that can be with trees of other species. They attract and feed a diverse array of creatures. Heterozygous, all apple trees produce unique fruit, so every uncultivated apple tree encountered represents a new strain of apple.

Extractive systems, including the Abstraction, are powerful engines, but in their artificiality there is an element of fragility. Often, they are forced to take longcuts where shortcuts might do. By encircling so much, by growing large, they become unaware of knowledge at the level of the local. By acting at scale, by coordinating the effort of many from above, they lose the ability to act simply. While there is a tailwind to be found by reaching up into the Abstraction to take advantage of centralizing and extractive trends, those working locally may be able to walk to where the Abstraction could visit only by building a highway. By cultivating thickets, dense webs of interdependent relationships, we obscure our work from above and protect spaces from whence further resistance might grow. Though growing literal thickets has its benefits[fn:no-mo], seeding various forms of richly interdependent community can preempt enclosure by abstractative forces. Wikipedia provides an example of one such thicket. Its presence makes economically unviable various forms of knowledge aggregation and resale, and its dense ecosystem of community relationships raises the cost of cooptation.

[fn:brewing] The author of this dissertation may or may not have brewed 13.5 gallons of cider in his New York apartment during the writing of this chapter. In addition, ten apple pies may or may not have been baked.

Another way to seed resistant local communities is through the encouragement of technologies, or techne, that naturally move users from passive consumption to active creation. Certain technologies do this almost inadvertently. For example, the early social media site MySpace has been credited for providing a path for young women into coding, since it required knowledge of HTML and CSS for more advanced customization of a profile.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
After high school Dalia made her own online shop, where she sold things like band pins and earrings, and that's when her MySpace skills came in handy. "I was doing the website and there were things that would bug me ... so I started to just go into the code and see a lot of the HTML and CSS that I had learned before. And from there I learned JavaScript." citep:hinojosa_tech_2016
#+END_QUOTE
Though MySpace, as a commercial platform, tended to be restrictive in its use, it did encourage the development of skills that might be used to develop alternative spaces. Other systems, such as Apple's HyperCard, had a similar influence, and the web abounds with stories of those who learned computers, or programming, after discovering it on early Macs.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
a child, I struggled to pick up programming. My brain didn’t think abstractly enough at the time. ... Programming didn’t click with my artistic mind. ... I instantly fell in love with HyperCard. ... I spent hours upon hours building little HyperCard decks, teaching myself their programing (sic)language called HyperTalk, and mostly just drawing citep:freeman_hypercard_2020
#+END_QUOTE
Though technologies such as MySpace, HyperCard, and Flash are proprietary and, therefore, do not provide certain essential freedoms to their users, they do have some properties of what J. Ryan Stinnett and Konrad Hinsen call malleable systems and which Adam Wiggins has called end-user programming. Malleable systems, according to Stinnett and Hinsen, follow a number of principles. They should be easy to change, enable arbitrary reuse, have open-ended potential, allow users to retain ownership and control, facilitate free sharing, permit modification in the course of use, and be thoughtfully crafted citep:stinnett_mission_2019. End-user programming, in turn, embraces the principles of embodiment, meaning that system logic is transparent in the interface; in-place modification , meaning that a separate tool or environment is not needed for making changes; and living system, meaning that the time between making a tweak and seeing results is as close to immediate as possible citep:wiggins_end-user_2019. According to Stinnett and Hinsen, greatest interest in malleable systems peaked in the 1970s and 1980s with Lisp machines and the Xerox Alto. On both these systems, all elements of the computer, including the interface, could be trivially customized, without even the necessity of restarting the computer to propagate changes. While some popular systems, such as WordPress, have a few elements of malleable systems, in general the full capabilities of malleable systems have not been explored. Malleable systems are, in a sense, haccessible—that is, they make relatively straightforward the kinds of customization for accessibility that can only be achieved with great difficulty. By investing in the creation of malleable systems, we can allow the development of community infrastructure in ways that are impossible to anticipate, and we can also further capabilities and knowledge in individuals and groups that are commonly left out of more conventional approaches to making and building.

Malleable systems are one potential avenue for what, in this chapter, I have called techne, or technology that increases autonomy rather than serving to disempower and exploit. If "tech" represents a specific playbook—leverage cheap capital to outspend and outgrow competitors, , exploit community cohesion as network effects, employ dark patterns to steer users to desired behaviors and outcomes—then it is past time to develop a coherent playbook for the creation of technology that relinquishes control to individuals and small groups. Starting points for explorations of techne in the realm of bits might be the free and open source software movements discussed in Chapter Two, the subversive and joyfully brutalist websites of underground artists such as porpentine, or the infrastructural adaptability of the lay hermaneutic communities discussed in Chapter Four. 

However, techne cannot and should not be confined to the digital. In recognizing and furthering techne, we should place emphasis on the cultivation and incorporation of manual and domestic disciplines such as herbalism, carpentry, cooking, brewing, mechanics, and knitting. Like the internal and external martial arts and movement disciplines such as parkour, running, and buildering, traditional and modern manual and domestic disciplines are essential for building local community and drive advocacy for the preservation and expansion of common spaces. These disciplines also allow the independent development and maintenance of local infrastructure, are key to encouraging physical and mental health, and, historically, have inspired forms of political Resistance.[fn:political-resistance] This form of practice, in which coding, engineering, and traditional manual disciplines are blurred, exists in some specialist communities such as makerspaces. Creating new physical and digital spaces for gathering, learning, and building, and democratizing existing specialist spaces, suggest one way forward for a techne with potential to reverse a daunting trend toward abstraction and alienation.

[fn:political-resistance] The development of many, perhaps even most, martial arts can be linked to political resistance. Capoeira, for example, was developed by enslaved Africans in Brazil, and incorporates movements that resemble dance to facilitate training in secret. Other physical disciplines such as night climbing, or the scaling of buildings under cover of darkness, can be considered forms of civil disobedience. The manual discipline of lockpicking is so commonly practiced among computer hackers that almost every major conference on computer security hosts sessions on it.

[fn:no-mo] A no-mow movement, recognizing that lawns are ecological dead zones and that the environment is better served by allowing yards to grow wild with non-invasive plants and animals, has gained momentum in the United States since the late 2010s. In arid regions of the United States, lawns account for 75% of water use, and use of fertilizers and pesticides on lawns are a major contribution to the contamination of ground water citep:ignatieva_alternative_2018. One homeowner who decided to let her lawn grow writes on the rapid ecological transformation: "The unmowed plants in our yard attract plant-eating bugs and rodents, which in turn attract birds, bats, toads and garter snakes that eat them. Then hawks fly in to eat the snakes. Seeing all this life emerge in just one growing season made me realize just how much nature manicured lawns displace and disrupt" citep:pullano_is_2019.


# !!! END FOOTNOTE

This chapter has outlined a process, system or entity, the Abstraction, composed in part of dynamics and trends that incentivize alienation from community, prediction for profit, the modeling and manipulation of populations, and the replacement of local autonomy with control from above. We have also considered the Abstraction as undermining narratives that enable useful political action—as we explored in Chapter Three, certain kinds of complexity resist the formation of galvanizing or coordinating stories. While we have examined some suggestive ways forward, one may reasonably look at local effort, local approaches based on local knowledge, as fundamentally paltry. How can our little work, undertaken with our little understanding, challenge an energetic, global, and centralized leviathan? How can we, in our smallness, confront a construct that has engulfed the world in its totality? Should not we fight size with size, scale with scale, control with control? To defeat the Abstraction, must we not raise another, new and perfect and of our own design?

We should not embrace the thinking behind the Abstraction in order to resist it. While we cannot truly understand the entirety of the system that encloses us, this lack of understanding works both ways. Systems at scale will never truly understand the local. Just as we find ourselves subject to random acts of postmodernity as the Abstraction finds purchase, ideas of small origin cannot be fully anticipated or incorporated into the models built to predict our thoughts and actions. The map is not the territory, and we are the smudged lines that mark the secret places.

It may seem that our actions are futile against the scale of the system that stands against us. This is a reasonable fear. Most of our efforts , almost by definition, will make little dent in the edifice that encloses us. The Abstraction is vast and strong. A given individuals contribution has never been so meaingless. And yet—the specific contribution, the one that does or will make a difference, has never been so meaningful. In an interconnected world, the right insight, shared at the right time, can seed a new form of community or start a movement. But without preparing the ground—creating thickets, maintaining loacl networks, pushing back against new forms of exploitation—there will be no tinder for a stray spark to ignite.

Like many, I carry around a vision of what the world might be. In this world, the interfaces would talk to each other. The people would talk to each other. We would use computers in ways that fit our bodies and minds. We would read without intermediaries, teach without intermediaries, build without intermediaries. Infrastructure would exist for our adaptation, encouraging creativity over conformity. Our goals, and the texture of our lives, would not be neatly divided between the trivial, that which is anticipated for us, and the impossible. Such a vision for the world, however, cannot be implemented, constructed, or imposed. It must grow. To make the universal serve us, small and awkward creatures forced to live in fixity, , we must write the book and leave the last page blank. We must create in hope for use, but not in its anticipation.

As we have seen, the future is always in a process of becoming. We stand at a perpetual crux. We pursue, and seek to create, worlds we cannot contain in the present, worlds for which glimpses are gifts and, we hope, guides. We each carry our own vision. I see it in others as a flame, guttering, perhaps, but with the potential to spread from mind to mind. It illuminates our locality, and in that tight space casts back the Abstraction. In gathering, we create not a sun, but a sky deep with stars, mysterious and bright. And, though the challenge before us is great, we must take seriously the possibility that we are equal to it.

# Yet wild apple trees have profound spiritual, emotional, and companionship value to anyone who escapes the pressures of keeping up, and at the physical level they offer food to animals (and to people who have been spit out from that economy). Aside from free fruit, I personally can trace much of my inspiration, many of my ideas, and many of my insights to simply being with wild apple trees. I place their highest value in the pricelessness of companionship. In this sense wild apple trees live in other economies, ones that prioritize beauty, uniqueness, nutrition, taste—just to name just a few things that are often in direct conflict with a growing financial economy.

# Nonetheless I’m very uneasy about pinning my hopes on anything connected to a financial economy dependent on growth. After all, some things cannot be scaled up.

# Myth of the machine
:notes:
# In terms of the currently accepted picture of the relation of man to technics, our age is passing from the primeval state of man, marked by his invention of tools and weapons for the purpose of achieving mastery over the forces of nature, to a radically different condition, in which he will have not only conquered nature, but detached himself as far as possible from the organic habitat.

# With this new 'megatechnics' the dominant minority will create a uniform, all-enveloping, super-planetary structure, designed for automatic operation. Instead of functioning actively as an autonomous personality, man will become a passive, purposeless, machine-conditioned animal whose proper functions, as technicians now interpret man's role, will either be fed into the machine or strictly limited and controlled for the benefit of de-personalized, collective organizations.

# -----

# In this process of self-discovery and self-transformation, tools, in the narrow sense, served well as subsidiary instruments, but not as the main operative agent in man's development; for technics has never till our own age dissociated itself from the larger cultural whole in which man, as man, has always functioned. The classic Greek term 'tekhne' characteristically makes no distinction between industrial production and 'fine' or symbolic art; and for the greater part of human history these aspects were inseparable, one side respecting the objective conditions and functions, the other responding to subjective needs.

# -----

# The irrational factors that have sometimes constructively prompted, yet too often distorted, man's further development became plain at the moment when the formative elements in paleolithic and neolithic cultures united in the great cultural implosion that took place around the Fourth Millennium B.C.: what is usually called 'the rise of civilization.' The remarkable fact about this transformation technically is that it was the result, not of mechanical inventions, but of a radically new type of social organization: a product of myth, magic, religion, and the nascent science of astronomy. This implosion of sacred political powers and technological facilities cannot be accounted for by any inventory of the tools, the simple machines, and the technical processes then available. Neither the wheeled wagon, the plow, the potter's wheel, nor the military chariot could of themselves have accomplished the mighty transformations that took place in the great valleys of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and India, and eventually passed, in ripples and waves, to other parts of the planet.

# The study of the Pyramid Age I made in preparation for writing 'The City in History' unexpectedly revealed that a close parallel existed between the first authoritarian civilizations in the Near East and our own, though most of our contemporaries still regard modern technics, not only as the highest point in man's intellectual development, but as an entirely new phenomenon. On the contrary, I found that what economists lately termed the Machine Age or the Power Age, had its origin, not in the so-called Industrial Revolution of the eighteenth century, but at the very outset in the organization of an archetypal machine composed of human parts.

# Two things must be noted about this new mechanism, because they identify it throughout its historic course down to the present. The first is that the organizers of the machine derived their power and authority from a heavenly source. Cosmic order was the basis of this new human order. The exactitude in measurement, the abstract mechanical system, the compulsive regularity of this 'megamachine,' as I shall call it, sprang directly from astronomical observations and scientific calculations. This inflexible, predictable order, incorporated later in the calendar, was transferred to the regimentation of the human components. As against earlier forms of ritualized order, this mechanized order was external to man. By a combination of divine command and ruthless military coercion, a large population was made to endure grinding poverty and forced labor at mind-dulling repetitive tasks in order to insure "Life, Prosperity, and Health" for the divine or semi-divine ruler and his entourage.

# The second point is that the grave social defects of the human machine were partly offset by its superb achievements in flood control and grain production, which laid the ground for an enlarged achievement in every area of human culture: in monumental art, in codified law, in systematically pursued and permanently recorded thought, in the augmentation of all the potentialities of the mind by the assemblage of a varied population, with diverse regional and vocational backgrounds in urban ceremonial centers. Such order, such collective security and abundance, such stimulating cultural mixtures were first achieved in Mesopotamia and Egypt, and later in India, China, Persia, and in the Andean and Mayan cultures: and they were never surpassed until the megamachine was reconstituted in a new form in our own time. Unfortunately these cultural advances were largely offset by equally great social regressions.

 # Many have attempted to place their finger on this force, this process or entity. For Hardt and Negri, it was /Empire/. For Benjamin H. Bratton, it is /The Stack/. For Herbert Marcuse, it was the one-dimensional or technological society [[citep:marcuse_one-dimensional_2002][p. 50]]. For Neil Postman, it was /technopoly/. My own colleague at the Graduate Center, Erin Glass, has described it, in the context of the academy, as the /invisible discipline/. XXX Though those who attempt to identify and define it each have a different sense of its shape, its scale, and its ends, there is a general sense that it is technocratic and technological—that is, comprising within itself systems of both humans and machines. There is also a sense that it is impersonal and encompassing—international or global in scope. In this project, I'll call this thing—this presence or process or entity—the /unhuman/. In using negation to identify it, I invoke humanity, a concept both elevated and workaday and also acknowledge that I am incapable of precisely, or even imprecisely, defining it.

# There is a precipitous verticality to the structure and language of this machine-dominated present. Benjamin H. Bratton acknowledges this in adopting an inherently vertical term to describe an emerging political geography that "draws on the multilayered structure of software, hardware, and network 'stacks' that arrange different technologies vertically within a modular, interdependent order" citep:bratton_stack:_2016. Verticality, a height that exceeds our reach, also provides a dimension along which to think about whether technology is within our control or whether we are in the control of technology. In /Woman on the Edge of Time/, when Connie first steps into Luciente's future, she envisions a world of dominating, thrusting structures: "[r]ocket ships, skyscrapers into the stratosphere, an underground mole world miles deep." Instead, the structures she does encounter are personal and broadly accessible, horizontal rather than vertical: "[a]rm in arm they strolled toward the meetinghouse, a building long and low like a loaf of bread" XXX. We see this distinction, too, in Connie's present. While part of her vision of freedom is "a TV set that she could turn on and off and tune to whatever program she wanted to watch," part of the indignity of the mental hospital is a lack of this kind of control over her environment: "[w]omen ... were sitting vacantly along the walls or staring at the television set placed up on a shelf where no one could reach it to change the station or alter the volume level." For these incarcerated women, technology is situated outside, literally above, their control. In this increasingly present future, technology is not something that we participate in as equals. More and more, it is something that happens to us.

# This project, /Negotiated Access/, is about the locus of interaction—the point or edge along which we encounter our environment and exercise our autonomy. Fundamentally, it's an argument that this locus needs to be shifted from the distant, the impersonal, and the complex and placed close to the individual and the small community. This means that technology should be something we make and control, not something that happens to us. It means that social structure and infrastructure should be flexible, fluid, and federated, not one size fits all. It means, to put it less abstractly, that the television needs to come down from the damn shelf.

# “Techne” derives from the Indo-European root “tek ” which accordin to Porkorny, means "to fit together the woodwork of a woven house." I(iibe concludes that “in its original form techne probably means the build- ing of a house which was woven together from trunks and twigs and was erected by the family or tribe in a communal effort.“ As social life became more settled, the need for building skills increased. As the division of labor: progressed, the work of building houses was no longer left to families It became the province of a specialized (in Gould’s words a “com arativel rare”) individual: the tektén, the “woodworker.” “Techne ” i: its re): Homeric meaning, came to refer to the knowledge or skill of fhe tekténp he who produces something from wood.

# One might ask, reasonably, what advantage lies in considering close reading, carpentry, kombucha brewing, gardening, oragami, cooking, or meditation as technologies, or alongside those activities we currently designate as technology.





# If the very concept of technology is now suspect—if tech is now a four-letter word—how do we move forward? Since the early to mid-2000s, the ideological stance of standing apart or above culturally transformative technology has become increasingly untenable. More and more, the practical, cultural, and infrastructural impact of information technology is not confined to specific spheres, but touches on almost every aspect of daily life—a process that Steven Jones terms the "eversion." As infrastructure and social norms change to accommodate widespread use of technology, opting out of technology, practically speaking, means opting out of society. We know that we cannot roll back these technological, cultural, and infrastructural changes, that there will be no reversion to counter this eversion. How, then, can we conceive of a technology that will take us from where we are now to where we need to be? How do we envision a future like Luciente's, one where technology serves, rather than controls, humanity?

# Rutsky suggests that, historically, technology has transformed from an instrumental force seeking to dominate nature, create material wealth, and separate the premodern from the modern into a form that places greater emphasis on aesthetics. Yet even as the position of technology in society changes, the nature of our discourse around technology mostly does not.

# from high techne
:notes:

# of a particular look or style, but of a cultural concern with “stylishness,”
# with “aesthetics,” that is intrinsic to high tech. Indeed, high tech is by defi-
# nition a technology that is “at the state of the art in terms of . . . function
# and design.” 6 To be “at the state of the art” implies not only a certain
# up-to-the-second currency, an attention to the latest technological devel-
# opments, but also a sense that both “function and design” have become
# elements in an aesthetic process or movement. As state-of-the-art tech-
# nology, high tech comes to be defined by its status as the “cutting edge”
# or “leading wave” of this technological aesthetic or style. Indeed, it is no
# coincidence that the often overblown rhetoric associated with high tech
# is reminiscent of the manifestos and slogans of the avant-garde artistic
# movements of the early twentieth century. High tech is, in fact, often pre-
# sented as a kind of avant-garde movement.
# There are, of course, good reasons to be extremely skeptical of the
# “avant-garde” rhetoric of high tech (as there are, for that matter, of the
# rhetoric of the modernist avant-gardes). If the rhetoric of the modernist
# avant-gardes served to distinguish an artistic vanguard from the rest of
# the population, the notion of a high-tech avant-garde privileges a “highly
# technological” vanguard that is also, often, “highly capitalist.” Yet, one
# crucial similarity that high tech does share with the modernist avant-
# gardes is that in both, the conjunction of the technological and the aes-
# thetic is a central concern. Moreover, the very fact that metaphors such as
# “state of the art” and “avant-garde” have been so commonly employed—
# and accepted—in describing high tech is evidence that an “aesthetic” di-
# mension has become part of the definition of contemporary technology.
# Technology has come increasingly to be seen as a matter of aesthetics or
# style, as an “aesthetic movement.” Given this “aesthetic” aspect, the con-
# cept of technology in high tech might well be thought of as a kind of high
# techne ̄ —analogous to, though certainly quite different from, the Greek
# notion of techne ̄.
# The question, then, of how the modern conception of technology has
# changed to a high techne ̄ will necessarily involve charting the vicissitudes,
# the history, of the relationship between the technological and the aes-
# thetic in modernity and beyond. Charting that history is, in fact, the proj-
# ect of this book. The book is, therefore, divided into two sections of two
# chapters each, with a transitional chapter between them: the first two
# chapters deal with the beginnings of this shift in the conception of tech-
# nology and of aesthetics, concentrating on relations of art and technology
# in artistic modernism; the last two chapters focus o

# My purpose, here and in this project, is not to say that we need more craft and less technology, or to engage the usual, unfortunately now quotidian forms of antitechnological resistance—retreat and abstention or disruption and destruction. That story, it seems to me, is written, and the genie rarely reenters the bottle. Technology, too often, is as Dickens wrote, "[t]he power that forced itself upon its iron way--its own--defiant of all paths and roads, piercing through the heart of every obstacle, and dragging living creatures of all classes, ages, and degrees behind it" [[citep:dickens_dombey_1848][p. 311]]. Technology, like culture, is mimetic, heedlessly spreading, moving forward, from mind to mind. Just as culture cannot be fought with anti-culture, but must be fought with more culture, we cannot fight technology with anti-technology. We must decide, then, how to steal the Promethean fire with which to fight fire.

# If "technology" evokes application of knowledge in service of control and domination, what terms, what forms and models, are left to us? By rights, technology should be a broader, more encompassing term, yet it is difficult to rally around a more holistic vision of technology when an unhuman Technology™ strives always to take its place in discourse.

# lynn white stuff, probably not great
:notes:
# In 1966, Lynn White, a historian at UCLA,  published an unusual book. /Medieval Technology and Social Change/ discussed a small set of frequently-overlooked innovations—the stirrup, the plow, the crank—arguing that they were largely responsible for the emergence of feudalism in the period. Though criticized, perhaps justly, as a lightweight adventure in technological determinism, the book's premise implied a lack of attention on the part of historians to technology associated with certain social strata—namely, those strata that did not possess the literacy or the cultural capital to pass on their own perspectives through histories and written records.

# When we think of "technology"—the concept or the word—we think of paradigms situated on the level of macro-scale entities and institutions—societies, nations, and corporations. This form of technology reaches, from on high, down into our lives. It offers us capabilities and connections, identity and convenience. It leverages iterative design, social science, and algorithm to nudge, rather than compel, recalcitrant humanity into engaging systems that control, flatten, and measure. We are grist in a highly abstract mill, our thoughts content, our relationships network effects, our differences market segments and our common humanity an exploited vulnerability. When we think of technology, we think of systems in which we are empowered only to the extent that we further render ourselves powerless.

# This narrow version of technology—Technology™—exerts a narrative pull. Lynn White's /Medieval Technology and Social Change/ was, and still is, notable in that it called attention to a technology of the immediate personal environment. The stirrup, the plow, and the crank, in transforming the relationship between people and their immediate environment—people and animals, people and land, people and things—precipitated extraordinary change in the wider society. Yet despite their broad implications, these hyperlocal changes tended to escape attention and analysis both contemporaneously and in hindsight. Similarly, highly local changes among people and their environments are not widely considered technology. To gather the narrative impetus or cultural cachet of /Technology™/, a knowledge of practice, a working, must meet arbitrary criteria—be conceived as a platform, be backed by venture capital, be in service of the few at the expense of the many.

# Is close reading not technology? Is a family recipe not an algorithm? Is a support group not a platform? Is a personal library not infrastructure? Certain forms of technology are glorified, even fetishized, while essential ways of knowing and doing are systematically undervalued. A technology, ultimately, is knowledge put into practice. Why do we hold up technologies of control, technologies of corporations, governments, and the powerful, while eliding, downplaying, disparaging, or ignoring the technology of individuals and localities, small groups and "little" disciplines?

# Greek philosophers used a term, /technē/, to describe an associative and conceptual space that is, in many ways, richer and broader than our own derived "technology." Tom Angier refers to the technai as "variously translatable as 'crafts', 'skills', 'arts' or 'forms of expertise'" [[citep:angier_techne_2012][p. 1]]. As with "technology," however, each of these terms has its own set of modern associations that make them inadequate as translations of /technē/. /Technē/ was most often used for knowing in service of a goal. It applied to professions such as medicine, teaching, and carpentry where knowledge and practice blurred in the service of a clear purpose.

# #+BEGIN_QUOTE
# From etymology and early usage, then, we can determine a property of /technē/ that will remain more or less constant: namely, that whoever practises a particular /technē/ possesses a determinate form of expertise. As Felix Heini- mann affirms, "Each /technē/ is correlated with a quite determinate [/bestimmte/] task and type of achievement' (106). Or as Rudolf Löbl puts it, for every /technē/ ‘there is a telos, a goal, at which it aims . . . a kind of job [Werk] or action, that has to be realised' (211). These references to particular ‘tasks' or ‘goals' should not be taken to preclude an individual /technē/ having as its proper concern a plurality of actions or products. After all, smithing (for one) encompasses a diverse set of these. ... It is in this sense, I take it, that ‘every /technē/ must have a quite determinate goal [/Ziel/], which distinguishes it from other technai'

Chairs to sit in, a table of her own to eat on, a TV set that she could turn on and off and tune to whatever program she wanted to watch, her own bed with clean sheets and no stink of old piss. Her precious freedom and privacy!

# Around her kitchen she would sing and dance, she would sing love songs to the cucarachas and the chinces, her chinces! Her life that had felt so threadbare now spread out like a full red velvet rose—the rose that Claud had once brought her, loving it for its silkiness, its fragrance, and not knowing it was dark red Her ordinary penny-pinching life appeared to her full beyond the possibility of savoring every moment. A life crammed overflowing with aromas of coffee, of dope smoke in hallways, of refried cooking oil as she climbed the stairs of her tenement, of the fragrance of fresh-cut grass and new buds in Central Park.

# We must make for ourselves, or be made upon.

# This is the foundational argument of this project, a project grounded in disability studies and traveling outward. 

# There are points of intersection between self and community, self and society, and community and society. The back-and-forth that occurs across these points, the negotiation among self, community, and society, is enabled and constrained by infrastructure—past decisions and creations that determine the possible and the impossible, the simple and the difficult, the accessible and the inaccessible. Though without infrastructure, individuals can do little, deliberate choices in how infrastructure is created constrain the self, coercing, influencing, or nudging the individual into the service of interests not their own. Infrastructure is necessary, but is frequently created to serve the powerful, the acquisitive, or the majoritarian.

# Infrastructure, however, can be turned, subverted, or reinvented to serve community and the individual. /Negotiated Access/ focuses on communities of practice—particularly communities of people with disabilities—who reforge the inaccessible into the accessible, or create knowledge and community in adverse circumstances.

# Receiving visitations from Luciente, an occupant of the year 2137, Connie is exposed to a society that values community, self-determination, autonomy, and environmental awareness—a future based on the civil rights and environmental movements that were only beginning to gain traction in the mid-70s. 

# Connie, while incarcerated and ground down by a relentless bureaucratic machine, has a burning sense of what could be, how her surroundings could reflect back her own autonomy instead of her own subjugation:

# Throughout the novel, Connie is, by turns, physically injured, insulted, and ignored at the hands of authority figures—social workers, mental ward attendants, doctors, and police. Yet perhaps most galling for her is the denial of autonomy over her immediate physical and social space, a betrayal not only of a connection to a wider community but also the immediate and necessary circumstances of life.

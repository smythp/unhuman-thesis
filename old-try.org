I write this book because I am not a person. I'm sitting here surrounded by screens and feeds, windows and terminals. I've popped open more mind-expanding tabs than Timothy Leary and my desktop is littered with the debris of four dozen projects. A terminal is scrolling by, cracking ebooks, and I spot the words "Chapter Detected." This is the beginning of my thesis, so let's hope so.

I feel like my thoughts used to come up from some place within me. They were pools, runoff from novels and walks and late-night conversations—and, yes, TV ads, cereal boxes, and pop songs. But these days I feel like my thoughts just run through me. The inevitable metaphor is the stream. It's hard to think without some kind of medium to think in. We're all just looking at things all the time, looking and looking. Consuming feeds, feeding our digital excrement back in to optimize the ph of our digital diet.

We dimly sense that humans aren't really the center of things anymore. The think pieces are all about A.I., which in its current state has some kind of business potential for perhaps four large tech conglamorates. But the shrill and frightened discussion of an existential threat to humanity relfect an underlying truth, that systems that aren't humans are taking center stage, that we're becoming the cokroaches scurrying from the kitchen light at midnight.

This thesis is about reading in a world where humans aren't important. Reading has always diminished us while making us something more. The grade-school bromides about reading say that reading transports you to a world far away, or allows you to pick the brains of long-dead interlocutors. That's all true. But reading also makes us feel our smallness, our parociality, our fixity in one time and place. At the same time, reading makes us part of a set of intellectual and narrative frameworks, enabling us to reach out to minds distant both chonolocally and geographically. But reading is now at the center of a new reality, one that removes nodes and vectors from old networks. These days, it's not just humans doing the reading: machines read us and one another, and larger systems learn through reinforcement to turn our ways and our words against us.

If we are to be vermin, then verminate we shall. As machines read us, let us read machines. Yet we don't ahve the vocabulary, the antibodies, the ammunition to read our way out of this mess. ANd we don't even know if reading is enough—perhaps we don't want to understand any more of this new world than we already do. But without understanding, no change can be effected. Or affected, for that matter. So let's talk about machines.

TALKING AVBOUT MACHINES

What do we associate with the machine? A machine is deterministic, it's predictable given the right inputs. Machine has the connotation of inexorability—"machines of war." Machine connotes a great plot—"machinations." Machines are systems with parts.







Hackcessability

Just as I have had to sneak around in a society not made for me by "hacking" my way, we all have to sneak around in a society that's made for creates larger than us.

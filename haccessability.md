# Introducing Negotiated Access<a id="orgheadline13"></a>

## Terry Garrett<a id="orgheadline1"></a>

On May 8, 2011, a blind gamer named Terry Garrett began playing Zelda: The Ocarina of Time. The game, widely considered a classic, depicts a 3D world populated with puzzles, enemies, and difficult terrain. It also offers no intentional concessions to a blind player using only sound cues, memory, and dogged persistence to navigate the game world. 

Five years later, Garrett completed his playthrough. Using binaural audio, he'd found that he could map entities and terrain in the environment. Inaudible features could be struck with objects to produce identifying sounds, and a combination of trial-and-error and external research allowed him to pass traps and solve puzzles.

What conception of disability allows us to best understand Garrett's achievement? Two models have come to dominate narratives of and advocacy for disability. The first, the medical model, sees disability as a personal tragedy that can only be resolved by a cure or mitigation from the medical community. Implicit in this perspective is the assumption that disability is a social aberration, a condition that must be cured or obscured. The social model of disability, on the other hand, envisions disability as a societal concern, and contends that most negative outcomes from disability stem from the ignorance, indifference, or bias of the wider, largely able, community. Proponents of the social model seek attitudinal and public policy changes to eliminate difficulties associated with stigma and a lack of understanding about disabled lives.

How well do these models address the challenges faced by Garrett as he, a blind gamer, engaged with a creation designed without knowledge of his circumstances? The solutions offered by the medical model offer only a binary outcome. Either Garrett's disability is cured or ameliorated, allowing him to engage with the game in the socially prescribed way, or it is not. If no cure is forthcoming, then the medical model of disability is silent, offering no further recourse. Under the medical model, therefore, the challenge Garrett has set for himself could only be regarded as an impossibility.

The social model has far more to offer. In the last few years, communication among disabled gamers and developers has led to the release of a small but notable list of games in formats accessible to those with mobility and sensory disabilities. This short list, which has included titles such as Skull Girls and King of Dragon Pass, has shown that awareness and advocacy can led to concrete change even in gaming, a community that is often explicitly ableist in its outlook and rhetoric. However, though notable, these successes have been limited in scope. The overwhelming majority of games and game developers do not consider the needs of mobility- and sensory-impaired gamers, and many developers that become aware of specific disabilities argue that it's simply impossible for them to adapt their games for those with disabilities such as missing limbs or blindness. Even disabilities that are common and relatively simple to mitigate in games, such as color blindness, have received only limited attention. Further, widely used platforms that must be navigated to access games in the first place, such as the menus on the Playstation 4 console or the Steam game distribution service for PC, remain inaccessible, even in the face of an ADA ruling that requires that, at minimum, the communications and chat features in games must be made accessible.

When considering Garrett's struggle to complete a game designed exclusively for sighted players, it's clear—and unsurprising to those following disability studies—that the perspective provided by the social model is more productive than that provided by the medical model. While the medical establishment would have little or no interest in Garrett's experience as a case study, the social model suggests ways that society could change to better accommodate the goals of Garrett and other disabled gamers. Were developers in games to equip menus with audio or voice cues, for example, gamers like Garrett would not be forced to memorize interfaces through trial and error or with sighted assistance. Despite the salience of the social model to Garrett's experience, however, there is an aspect—a critical aspect—of his effort that falls outside the usual scope of the social model as we know it.

The disabled experience is typically—though not universally—characterized by distinct relationships between the individual and the lived environment. Consider the cane, an implement that, in its differing forms, is almost metanymous with mobility and sensory disabilities. For the blind and for many who are mobility impaired, the cane is an emblem of independence. When picking up a cane, the relationship among certain disabled individuals and their lived environment is powerfully altered. Distances shrink and senses expand. Daniel Kish, an advocate for unorthodox mobility strategies for the blind, describes the experience:

> Now, moving forward, how do I manage today? &#x2026; Fortunately, I have my trusty long cane, longer than the canes used by most blind people. I call it my freedom staff.

Yet the cane, and the myriad other rhetorical, physical, cognitive, and emotional strategies deployed by the disabled, are not cures. Their use and deployment is necessarily idiosyncratic, unique to specific disabled individuals and their affinity groups. Their use or presence also often visibly sets disabled individuals apart. Unlike the medical cure, which seeks to normalize pathology and efface difference, the myriad strategies deployed by disabled people to negotiate physical and cultural spaces are a source of difference. This difference is primarily one of perception&#x2013;it goes both ways, consisting both of how disabled people are perceived by others and how they themselves perceive the world. XXX

Yet while we know that the medical model often fails to address or encompass disabled experience, the social model, for all its importance and usefulness, also does not address a significant portion of disabled life. In raising a cane—or in lip reading, using a screen reader, or adapting a vehicle to a mobility impairment——the disabled individual asserts a kind of power that does not flow from their approval or status in the wider community. Simultaneously, they assert their own identity, both individually and as part of an affinity group. Drawing on their understanding of their own situation and their relationship with the lived environment, the disabled individual *negotiates*. That is, they negotiate their environment, reforging relationships among their own bodies and the physical world. They negotiate with others, learning to survive in social milieus often characterized by ignorance and hostility. They share, build, and teach amongst themselves, creating negotiables—knowledge, physical infrastructure, and social capital that are their own. These practices, universal and critical to survival but often invisible and unacknowledged, I describe in this project as "negotiated access."

Models of disability combine a means of conceiving of or envisioning disability with a prescribed way forward—that is, a way of improving—or attempting to improve—the lives of disabled people. For the medical model, this prescribed way forward is the cure, an effacement of disability. For the social model, the way forward is social change in the wider society, including advocacy for and understanding of the lives of disabled people. This chapter will articulate and explore a third model of disability, the negotiated model, intended to augment the critical work already done under the aegis of the social model. Like existing models of disability, this model provides both a way to conceive of and situate disability and a way forward, a means of improving the lives of disabled people. 

This negotiated model is not a call for new types of work to be done to improve the lives of disabled people, because negotiated forms of access have been, and continue to be, practiced by people with disabilities in myriad forms. This model of access has, however, been underexamined in the context of disability studies and in the academy more widely. A goal of this project, therefore, is to focus attention on excellent work that is, and that arguably has always been, underway by practitioners in the wider disability community, and to provide a framework to better understand and contextualize this labor. Further, this project seeks to connect a theoretical understanding of negotiated access to related work in other domains. These connections include the digital humanities, with its emphasis on critical making and infrastructure, and utopian studies, which explores alternative relationships among bodies and their environments. Just as applications of the social model of disability have advanced discourses in a variety of disciplines, the negotiated model of disability can contribute to a wider understanding of affinity groups that develop practices, knowledges, and infrastructure that push back against complicit orthodoxy and normalizing forces.

So, again: what conception of disability allows us to best understand Garrett's achievement—completing, independently as a blind individual, a game designed exclusively for the sighted? If it's not yet clear, my answer to this question is the negotiated model of disability. While advocacy and social progress on the rights of disabled gamers might have helped, and could yet help, individuals such as Garrett, it was not this form of social progress that allowed Garrett to overcome this challenge. It also goes without saying that no (entirely theoretical) cure contributed to his victory. Rather, Garrett's accomplishment was the result of a successful negotiation of the lived environment. In approaching an apparently inaccessible game as he did, Garrett forced a redefinition of his relationship with it. creating infrastructure—a path—where no infrastructure existed before. Garrett's achievement also shares many characteristics of negotiated access that will be discussed in depth in this chapter, among them an idiosyncratic, exploratory,  or free-form approach ("haccessability"); the creation of new practices, knowledge, or material in service of a disability affinity group ("critical making"), and contribution to the formation of disabled affinity groups and a federated, rather than totalizing, disabled identity ("XXX").

Finally, it's essential to note that negotiated access is not an exceptional or extraordinary state for disabled individuals. Rather, it's a daily, or even hourly, fact of life. Case studies such as Garrett's and the others that will be discussed below garner focus and attention in both disabled and non-disabled communities, making them attractive for citation, discussion, and inclusion in a text such as this one. For disabled individuals, however, negotiation of the lived environment is simply a fact of life, one generally performed without fanfare or even, in most cases, acknowledgment. In addition, those individuals whose achievements come to wider public attention are often, despite their disabled status, privileged in other ways. While this study will attempt to balance extraordinary examples of negotiated access with those in keeping with the daily struggles and successes of disabled life, I wish to acknowledge that "notable" achievements in this context are unfortunately often those marked out by able, rather than disabled, communities. To the extent that it is possible within the bounds of this project, I have sought out first-hand accounts and voices of disabled experience whenever possible.

## What is Negotiated Access?<a id="orgheadline2"></a>

Negotiated Access is advocacy, knowledge creation,  and the building of infrastructure that begins within an affinity group and radiates outward. It's rooted in the lived experience of people with disabilities and its locus is the idiosyncratic capabilities, skills, and practices that enable people with disabilities to survive and (sometimes) flourish in an able and ableist society. Negotiated Access addresses aspects of the disabled experience that are marginal or underacknowledged within current paradigms, particularly methods that do not rely on, or defy, the approval or approbation of the wider society. In some cases, negotiation may require, or involve, passing—temporarily merging with the perception of the dominant able class to extract withheld support or necessary acknowledgement or concessions. At other times, negotiation involves practices that are considered asocial, resistant, or antisocial by the wider able community. Negotiation, therefore, tends to be at the periphery of the disabled experience, in the actions that are not easily narrativized or made legible by the community at large, but  which are a means of survival for individuals and their affinity groups.

While negotiated access flows from the personal and the idiosyncratic in the lives of people with disabilities, as a practice and as a critical lens it is also a vector for political and cultural energy. As we will see, negotiated access throws light on disability as an identity and the relationships among disability affinity groups, the narrativization of disability in media, the rise of transhumanism and the pathologization of humanity, the articulation of values through infrastructure, the implications of proprietary and commercial ideologies on the body, and the imagination and implementation of crip utopias. Negotiated access, and related concepts such as haccessibility, suggest ways we can advance both on-the-ground advocacy in the disabled community and augment our understanding of disability through the lens of the social model. Closely examining the unidealized, day-to-day interactions among disabled people and society, however, also raises a host of theoretical questions, not just about disabled life but also about how society at large reflects, or fails to reflect, our values.

## Hacking Accessibility<a id="orgheadline5"></a>

If infrastructure comprises material and social circumstances, such as roads, housing, communications systems, organizations, laws, and resources, that determine what is practical and possible, then haccessibility is the creation of personal infrastructure that expands the boundaries of the possible in ways that are personal, small-scale, and resistant to larger forces. The term can apply to anyone, whether teenagers (mis)using mentions of promoted brands on Facebook to receive a signal boost from its algorithm or the business executive who uses his desktop computer as a footstool. However, the term is most significant for the disabled, since adaptations, workarounds, prosthetics, individualized skills, and acts of provocation and resistance are critical to their ability to survive and thrive in an able world. Beyond its tendency toward self-determination, another critical aspect of haccessibility is its indifference to propriety and the need or desire to "pass" in wider society. Like the old-school hackers from which the term is derived, those who practice haccessibility often violate boundaries in order to expand their capabilities, explore their environment, and play at the boundaries of the acceptable, the possible, and the expected.

### Defining Haccessibility<a id="orgheadline4"></a>

1.  What is Hacking?

    "Hacker" is a contested term, one with a set of meanings and associations highly dependent on context and culture. For most, the hacker is figured as a modern-day boogieman or, at best, a trickster. In the news, depictions of the hacker have shifted from a suburban adolescent capable of bringing about nuclear Armageddon to a faceless assortment of criminal collectives to, more recently, the chosen tool of adversarial state actors for subverting Western institutions. Casually and less consistently, in cases of motivated interest the term hacker may be used to describe whistleblowers who exfiltrate data, such as Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden, or researchers who point out security vulnerabilities created by technical or policy decisions on the part of corporations or the government. In fiction, the hacker appears as an unreliable guide or, tamed, clears impediments from the path of the protagonist.
    
    The original use of the word "hacker," one that survives to this day in a number of subcultures, is quite different from this popular figuration. The terms "hack" and "hacker" originated at MIT in the early sixties amongst a group of technically-minded students, many of whom participated in MIT's Tech model train club, the AI lab, or both.
    
    > The core members hung out at the club for hours; constantly improving The System, arguing about what could be done next, developing a jargon of their own that seemed incomprehensible to outsiders who might chance on these teen-aged fanatics [&#x2026;]. [&#x2026;] one who insisted on studying for courses was a "tool"; garbage was called "cruft"; and a project undertaken or a product built not solely to fulfill some constructive goal, but with some wildpleasure taken in mere involvement, was called a "hack."
    
    For these early hackers, the word "hack" already had a number of related usages. One could "hack away" on a task or project, artlessly expending effort but making progress. One might implement a "quick hack," a suspect or unreliable solution that solves a problem in the short term. Most important, however, was the "excellent hack"—a striking or even transcendent solution that demonstrated intimate familiarity or mastery of a system.
    
    > But as the TMRC [Tech Model Railroad Club] people used the word, there was serious respect implied. While someone might call a clever connection between relays a "mere hack," it would be understood that, to qualify as a hack, the feat must be imbued with innovation, style, and technical virtuosity. [&#x2026;] The most productive people working on Signals and Power called themselves "hackers" with great pride.
    
    Hackers, in this early use of the word, were those who worked on a problem—often technical——out of passion rather than obligation, and who sought a deep understanding of a system or domain. This early hacker culture valued "playful cleverness" (Stallman, 2002), collaborative work, and the sharing of resources and results. They also frequently flouted rules, procedures, and restrictions on access, often in attempts to gain a commodity that, at the time, was highly valuable and frequently out of reach—computer time. 

## Shared Concerns<a id="orgheadline9"></a>

Both hackers and people with disabilities are, fundamentally, concerned with the problem of access. Old-school hackers—the XXX and Richard Stallmans of the world—care about access because they have a primal need to dig into the core of a machine, system, or program. Without the access granted through informal peer groups or initiatives such as the free and open source software movement, the kind of exploratory work with which these first hackers are associated becomes impossible. Hackers of the other stripe, those appearing in news stories about state actors and data breaches, are also concerned with (frequently unauthorized) access. By definition, these hackers are outsiders seeking entre

Much ink has been spilled over the relative legitimacy of various definitions of the word "hacker," particularly whether the term should be applied to criminals who gain unauthorized access to computers or curious and playful tecnophiles. In comparing elements of hacker culture to the concerns and practices of the disabled community, however, I will treat each of these interpretations of the term as legitimate. 

People with disabilities, especially those in certain affinity groups, often gravitate toward playful, clever, or community-minded resolutions to daily struggles, casting them in a role similar to the "original" hacker. At the same time, the need to surmount obstacles presented by lack of accessibility just as often casts people with disabilities in the role of the hacker as outsider, criminal, and suspect.

Clearly there are major differences in these communities, most notably that the subject position of the hacker as an outsider seeking access is frequently chosen, while the subject position of the disabled individual as an outsider is forced upon them.

While disabled gamers continue to pursue advocacy efforts, they have also engaged in a form of disability mitigation that is not generally acknowledged by the medical or social models of disability. If gaming interfaces are construed as a kind of infrastructure, one that attempts to determine not only the "what" of content and experience but also the "how" of method and interaction, then disabled gamers have, in large numbers, created their own infrastructure and support systems that defy constraints and carve new methods of engagement.

### Out in the Cold, or Why I Care About This Stuff<a id="orgheadline6"></a>

Imagine that you travel to a library. As you walk in, shelves of books rise up around you. They contain thousands of volumes, including discourses on every possible subject. That's ideal, since you're on a mission—a research mission.

As you step toward a promising section, a custodian firmly grasps your elbow. Unfortunately, it seems, these books are not for you. You are led to an out-of-the-way room. The floor is uneven, the surfaces dusty. Clearly, this room is rarely used, and receives little attention. Inside are a few shelves containing an odd assortment of books. It is here, you infer, that you are to do your research.

Casting a longing look at the wider library outside, you decide to make the best of a bad situation. Though the volumes you expected to find are absent, two books do seem to be tangentially related to your research. However, as you take them over to a table and prepare to take notes, the custodian rushes in. 

"This book cannot be placed on that table!" 

He picks up the second book and removes it to a cramped desk in the corner. Though your brow creases with confusion, you begin to skim the book before you, looking for a relevant chapter. After a minute, the custodian appears again. ?Only fifty pages per day!" He places a metal clip on the remaining pages, binding them tightly together.

For some reason, this limitation is the last straw for you. You gather up your notes and what remains of your dignity and move toward the exit. You feel defeated, but a spark of something—defiance?—has been ignited within you. Somehow, you know, you'll find a way to read those books&#x2026;

---

An experience common to disability is being denied what others take as given. Whether ingress at a venue, the instruction conveyed at a lecture, or the knowledge contained in a building full of print books, commodities that are freely accessible to others must either be expensively procured, fought for, or done entirely without by people with disabilities.

The vignette above is my own attempt to partially convey my own subjective experience as a low-vision researcher. FOr me, print books are not artifacts that readily give up their secrets. Depending on the length of the book, it's physical characteristics, and whether I'm willing to destroy it in the process—mostly not an option—any book not already in digital form requires two to ten hours of laborious scanning and processing before it can be read. While this means that few print books are strictly inaccessible to me—though such books do exist, including those in nonstandard or archaic scripts—it does mean that I must be strategic in which print books I choose to address in my research.

Of course, the relatively recent rise of ebooks and related digital formats has proven a major boon to researchers—such as myself—who cannot read print. Access to a digital book circumvents the need for laborious scanning, and the result is often far superior, since imperfections in the scanning and optical character recognition processes often lead to unreadable text and the appearance of undesirable artifacts. Further, books that are machine-readable and shared online are also transformative for individuals with dyslexia and those who may have difficulty accessing a physical library. Access to digital books can also be an asset, or even a necessity, for non-disabled researchers who may not be geographically or economically situated for physical access to an institution or a community of supportive  practitioners.

While digital books can, in theory, level the playing field for many disadvantaged readers, the experience of accessing such books is often, in keeping with the above vignette, prohibitively difficult. Most publishers, such as XXX and XXX, and digital book platforms, such as Ebrary, implement Digital Rights Management (DRM), impose usage limits, or require that books be read in the browser rather than downloaded, all in an attempt to prevent sharing or other copyright violations. Unfortunately, these interfaces are often not screen reader accessible, and reading a book in the browser is typically not feasible for those who read using text-to-speech or other assistive technology. These interfaces are often considered cumbersome  even by able users, and the inconsistency and fragmentation in these platforms also makes it difficult to extract quotations, take notes, or archive copies for further reading or future reference. 

It's difficult to fully convey the subjective experience of finding a book in a digital library and being, so to speak, turned away at the door. This experience is compounded by the knowledge that this denial is the product of a deliberate choice, or series of choices, on the part of the copyright holder or platform designer. Unlike print books, which require an active step in order to be made accessible, digital books require an active step to be made inaccessible. Unfortunately, this active step is too often taken, leaving those with print disabilities without access to essential resources.

What recourse does a blind researcher have when confronted with an inaccessible platform? One option is to purchase all books available in digital form. Unfortunately, academic books are often priced not for individuals, but for purchase by libraries, and these books can, in 2017, run in price from $80 to a heart-palpitating $300 for reference works, textbooks, or some edited collections. These costs often mean that the outlay for a second examination or thesis project could potentially run into the five figures. Unless one is independently wealthy, this is mostly not a viable choice for sourcing books for research.

Another option is to seek assistance from one's institution, whether through one's department or through a dedicated office of disability services. Results achieved through this approach can vary widely. These administrative services are often under-resourced.  XXX

While I have availed myself of these approaches in the past, my own methods for gaining access to these initially inaccessible bodies of knowledge are a little different. First, it requires an deep familiarity with the environment in which digital books are procured, stored, and consumed. Second, it demands significant investment, not only in knowledge but in various kinds of infrastructure. Lastly, it depends on an unconventional—or, perhaps more accurately, a /circuventional/—approach to access, one that seizes on alternative, creative, or exploratory routes to access. While this investment has demanded time and attention, the end product is that, rather than asking others to help me in sourcing research, I am frequently asked by other researchers for help in collecting materials for their own work.

The point of these observations is not to serve as a recommendation or recipe for other disabled researchers. Far from it—if anything, the amount of investment, of time and personal capital, required for such an approach shows only the difficulty and irreproducability of these methods. Instead, I share this background in order to frame my own interest in, and advocacy for, /haccessibility/—an approach to accessibility that draws on a culture that grew up around early computing, free and open source software, and the modern maker community.

RMS: It means someone who enjoys playful cleverness, especially in programming but other media are also possible. In the 14th century, Guillaume de Machaut wrote a palindromic three-part musical composition. It sounded good, too—I think I played in it once, because I still remember one of the parts. I think that was a good hack. I heard somewhere that J. S. Bach did something similar.
One possible arena for playful cleverness is breaking security. Hackers never had much respect for bureaucratic restrictions. If the computer was sitting idle because the administrators wouldn't let them use it, they would sometimes figure out how to bypass the obstacles and use it anyway. If this required cleverness, it would be fun in itself, as well as making it possible to do other hacking (for instance, useful work) on the computer instead of twiddling one's thumbs. But not all hackers did security breaking. Many never were interested in that.

It is the applications of the technology benefiting disabled people that have brought me the greatest gratification. There is a fortuitous match between the capabilities of contemporary computers and the needs of a disabled person. We're not creating cybernetic geniuses today—not yet. The intelligence of our present-day intelligent computers is narrow, which can provide effective solutions for the narrow deficits of most disabled persons. The restricted intelligence of the machine works effectively with the broad and flexible intelligence of the disabled person. Overcoming the handicaps associated with disabilities using AI technologies has long been a personal goal of mine. With regard to the major physical and sensory disabilities, I believe that in a couple of decades we will come to herald the effective end of handicaps. As amplifiers of human thought, computers have great potential to assist human expression and to expand creativity for all of us. I hope to continue playing a role in harnessing this potential. (Kurzweil 128)

Deaf persons—or anyone with a hearing impairment—commonly use portable speech-to-text listening machines, which display a real-time transcription of what people are saying. The deaf user has the choice of either reading the transcribed speech as displayed text, or watching an animated person gesturing in sign language. These have eliminated the primary communication handicap associated with deafness. Listening machines can also translate what is being said into another language in real time, so they are commonly used by hearing people as well. Computer-controlled orthotic devices have been introduced. These "walking machines" enable paraplegic persons to walk and climb stairs. The prosthetic devices are not yet usable by all paraplegic persons, as many physically disabled persons have dysfunctional joints from years of disuse. However, the advent of orthotic walking systems is providing more motivation to have these joints replaced. There is a growing perception that the primary disabilities of blindness, deafness, and physical impairment do not necessarily impart handicaps. Disabled persons routinely describe their disabilities as mere inconveniences. Intelligent technology has become the great leveler. (Kurzweil 139)

Prediction for 2019:

Blind persons routinely use eyeglass-mounted reading-navigation systems, which incorporate the new, digitally controlled, high-resolution optical sensors. These systems can read text in the real world, although since most print is now electronic, print-to-speech reading is less of a requirement. The navigation function of these systems, which emerged about ten years ago, is now perfected. These automated reading-navigation assistants communicate to blind users through both speech and tactile indicators. These systems are also widely used by sighted persons since they provide a high-resolution interpretation of the visual world. Retinal and vision neural implants have emerged but have limitations and are used by only a small percentage of blind persons. Deaf persons routinely read what other people are saying through the deaf persons' lens displays. There are systems that provide visual and tactile interpretations of other auditory experiences such as mus ic, but there is debate regarding the extent to which these systems provide an experience comparable to that of a hearing person. Cochlear and other implants for improving hearing are very effective and are widely used. Paraplegic and some quadriplegic persons routinely walk and climb stairs through a combination of computer- controlled nerve stimulation and exoskeletal robotic devices. Generally, disabilities such as blindness, deafness, and paraplegia are not noticeable and are not regarded as significant. (Kurzweil 145)

prediction for 2029:

The prevalence of highly intelligent visual navigation devices for the blind, speech-to-print display devices for the deaf, nerve stimulation, intelligent orthotic prosthetics for the physically disabled, and a variety of neural implant technologies has essentially eliminated the handicaps associated with most disabilities. Sensory-enhancement devices are in fact used by most of the population. (Kurzweil 162)

Such inclusiveness, however, requires an acceptance of diverse attitudes and opinions. Even if the majority of people we would classify as having disabilities perceived societal mistreatment and institutional barriers to be more oppressive than their diagnoses, not all of them would share that view or agree on the best response. African-Americans have different views about affirmative action, and many women do not believe that the option of legal abortion is essential for women's full participation in society. Disability theorists can find it frustrating that most nondisabled people in bioethics dispute their claims about their experience, but those theorists must respond to whatever challenge to the social model is posed by people with disabilities who see their condition, and not society, as the major impediment to their living rewarding lives. Many people with both congenital and acquired disabilities have said that they don't want cures but do want societal change, but that hardly warrants the charge that Christopher Reeve wasn't speaking from his experience of disability when he argued that what he wanted was “cure” and not social change (Johnson, 2003; Shakespeare, 2006).

### Pride Against Prejudice<a id="orgheadline24"></a>

It took me a long time after my accident to feel good about being out in public with other disabled people. For me the breakthrough came when I was leaving a meeting in the company of a disabled man. As we came towards the doors leading out of the building a woman rushed up, saying, 'Let me open the doors for you' (her attitude of 'Poor things' written all over her face and oozing out of her voice). But, before she could push her way in front of us — as people trying to open doors do so often — the doors opened automatically. 'Oh!' she cried, 'Isn't that clever. How does it work?' \`I don't know,' I said, 'I'm not an electrician.' And we sailed through the doors, leaving her open-mouthed and superfluous.  

Thinking about this incident afterwards I realised I felt a feeling of power which came from two sources — the feeling of solidarity with another disabled person at whom her pity was also directed, and the fact that, for once, the physical environment had been altered to suit people like me. The automatic doors meant that I did not have to accept help from someone whose help was offered on her terms and not mine. (Morris 30)

Scholars such as David Doat have criticized transhumanism, an ideological stance and subculture advanced by technologists and futurists, especially those like Ray Kurzweil who have a connection to Silicon Valley. He and others have observed that transhumanists regard the disabled as rhetorical stepping stones who provide evidence of an essential incompleteness in humanity that must be overcome with technology. This allows transhumanists to assume the role of saviors, creating infrastructure for others while determining the boundaries of what is reasonable, achievable, and desirable.

I accept this critique of the transhuman ideology, yet in rejecting the role advocates of transhumanism have created for the disabled, I wish to advance a means of understanding personal relationships among the individual, technology, and society. Haccessibility is the creation of infrastructure, broadly construed, that enables individual self-determination within a world that is socially and technologically determined. If infrastructure comprises material and social circumstances, such as roads, housing, communications systems, organizations, laws, and resources, that determine what is practical and possible, then haccessibility is the creation of personal infrastructure that expands the boundaries of the possible in ways that are personal, small-scale, and resistant to larger forces. The term can apply to anyone, whether teenagers (mis)using mentions of promoted brands on Facebook to receive a signal boost from its algorithm or the business executive who uses his desktop computer as a footstool. However, the term is most significant for the disabled, since adaptations, workarounds, prosthetics, individualized skills, and acts of provocation and resistance are critical to their ability to survive and thrive in an able world. Beyond its tendency toward self-determination, another critical aspect of haccessibility is its indifference to propriety and the need or desire to "pass" in wider society. Like the old-school hackers from which the term is derived, those who practice haccessibility often violate boundaries in order to expand their capabilities, explore their environment, and play at the boundaries of the acceptable, the possible, and the expected.

This section will advocate for haccessibility as a means of understanding the multivalent intersections among individuals and their social and technological contexts. It will also provide examples of ways in which institutional morays, practices, and rules have been (and often must be) violated by disabled individuals in pursuit of their goals. This chapter will draw on works such as Donna Haraway's *Cyborg Manifesto*, Richard Stallman's *Free Software, Free Society*, and Scott Dexter and Samir Chopra's *Decoding Liberation* in addition to foundational works in disability studies, especially those relating to post- and transhumanism. The chapter will also examine communities that have formed around the practice of hacking personal infrastructure, such as [Blind Arduino](http://blarbl.blogspot.com/), [Talking Arch](https://talkingarch.tk/), and [seeingwithsound](https://www.seeingwithsound.com/android.htm).

I know I mentioned Giambattista Vico, who argues that the certainty of mathematics derives from the fact that we created it, which gives us an “inside” view of it.  Vico is a pretty difficult thinker to get into, but Isaiah Berlin’s essay on him is a good place to start.
